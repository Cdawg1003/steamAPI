The long-awaited, heavily hyped, Source 2-powered evolution of the greatest tactical shooter of all time. And what did we get? A broken mess that makes you appreciate Counter-Strike: Global Offensive—a game we all spent years complaining about.\\n\\nFirst, let's talk about the servers. You ever wanted to experience what it’s like to time travel? Well, now you can! Thanks to CS2’s incredible sub-tick system, every gunfight feels like you're guessing where the past version of your opponent might be, while the future version of yourself is already dead. Laggy peeks, input delay, and rubberbanding galore—it’s like Valve found the worst possible way to implement online gameplay and ran with it.\\n\\nThen, we have the cheaters. Oh boy. If you ever dreamed of playing against professional aimlock enthusiasts in every second game, CS2 has you covered. The VAC system? Think of it as a museum piece—nice to look at but completely useless. Mass reporting doesn’t work, the cheaters never get banned, and somehow, they always win. It's almost impressive.\\n\\nBut don’t worry, CS2 did bring improvements! They gave us volumetric smokes—because that’s what everyone wanted, right? Not better matchmaking, not reliable hit registration, but dynamic, 3D smokes that look cool while you get shot through them by someone using wallhacks.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Valorant exists, a game that actually runs well, has anti-cheat that does something, and doesn’t make you question if your bullets are real or just imaginary suggestions to the game engine.\\n\\nOverall, Counter-Strike 2 is like getting a birthday gift from Valve where they take away your old toy and give you a newer, shinier, but completely broken version of it. 0/10 experience when playing, 10/10 experience when uninstalling.\", 'timestamp_created': 1740056503, 'timestamp_updated': 1740056503, 'voted_up': False, 'votes_up': 56, 'votes_funny': 8, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.793558597564697266', 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': False, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}\n",

The game that made Winner Winner Chicken Dinner a phrase worth fighting for. If you\\'ve spent 202.5 hours in this war-torn, loot-scavenging, tension-filled world, then you know the drill: Drop. Loot. Shoot. Pray the circle favours you. But does PUBG still hold up in 2025, or has it been outgunned by newer battle royals? Let’s break it down.  \\n\\n---\\n\\nThe Good Stuff \\n\\n✅ Realistic, Intense Gunplay  \\nPUBG doesn’t hold your hand—every firefight is high-stakes and tactically demanding. Whether it’s a long-range sniper battle or a last-circle shotgun duel, gunplay feels authentic and satisfying** (when desync isn’t ruining your day).  \\n\\n✅ Diverse Maps & Gameplay Variety \\nFrom the wide-open fields of Erangel to the close-quarters chaos of Sanhok, PUBG offers a variety of ways to die horribly—I mean, strategies to win. The evolving map pool keeps things fresh, even after hundreds of hours.  \\n\\n✅ Adrenaline-Packed Moments \\nPUBG’s magic lies in the tension. The sweaty-palmed final circles, the unexpected ambushes, the sheer panic when a squad rolls up in a UAZ—it’s an emotional rollercoaster every match.  \\n\\n✅ Now Free-to-Play \\nSince going F2P, the game is more accessible than ever. New players can jump in, though whether they’ll survive long enough to enjoy it is another question.  \\n\\n---\\n\\nThe Not-So-Great Stuff \\n\\n❌ Bugs, Glitches, & the Occasional Rage-Inducing Desync  \\nPUBG has improved massively since its early days, but let’s be real—it’s still got jank. Bullets sometimes refuse to hit targets, vehicles behave like haunted rollercoasters, and you will** die to the blue zone because your vault animation bugged.  \\n\\n❌ Steep Learning Curve (Especially for New Players)\\nPUBG doesn’t throw flashy abilities or easy mechanics at you. It’s a brutal, skill-based game that rewards experience—but that also means new players get destroyed instantly. If you\\'re not a veteran, expect to spectate a lot at first.  \\n\\n❌ Cheaters & Hackers Still Exist\\nEven with anti-cheat improvements, hackers occasionally turn a promising match into a \"well, that was pointless\" experience. Nothing ruins PUBG faster than getting lasered by some wallhacking tryhard.  \\n\\n❌ Pacing Issues (AKA 20-Minute Looting Simulations)\\nSometimes, you spend **half a match looting, finding zero enemies—only to get third-partied the moment you engage in a fight. It’s the PUBG experience in a nutshell: hours of patience, moments of panic, and seconds of pure regret.\\n\\n---\\n\\nFinal Verdict: Should You Play It?\\n\\nIf you love tactical, high-risk firefights, PUBG is still one of the most intense shooters out there. The gunplay is top-tier, the maps keep evolving, and every match tells a different story—sometimes tragic, sometimes hilarious. But it’s not for the faint of heart. The game can be brutal, frustrating, and buggy, but if you’ve stuck with it for over 200 hours, you already know the struggle.  \\n\\nScore: 8/10 – Still one of the best, but prepare for pain. \\n\\nWould I recommend it? Yes—if you have the patience for slow, tactical gameplay and the mental strength to lose in the dumbest ways possible.', 'timestamp_created': 1741879073, 'timestamp_updated': 1741879073, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 3, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.554568231105804443', 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': False, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}\n",

I also played the older live service games, Monster hunter frontier and Monster hunter online. Here are my thoughts on wilds (HR70/50 hours in game at time of writing):\\n\\n\\nPositives-\\n\\nPOOGIE IS BACK\\n\\nMonster hunter wilds is really fun, and anyone familiar with the series will like it a lot. The gameplay loop hasn\\'t changed, and capcom has implemented a ton of quality of life changes that make it more accessible to people who want to hunt more and grind materials less.\\n\\nThe new monsters are all really cool, along with their weapon and armor designs. Capcom does not miss when it comes to aesthetics in these games.\\n\\nAs a veteran hunter, I was worried the combat in this game would not be as enjoyable as previous titles, and while hunts are the easiest they have ever been, the attacks and animations in this game FEEL SO GOOD you basically don\\'t notice. I have not used seikret or mantels during combat to make it more challenging, and used un-upgraded starting armor through LR6, but throughout the whole story (both low and high rank) I only carted [died] about 3 times, and did not fail a single quest. I was planning on avoiding using focus mode and exploiting wounds as well, but honestly they are so fun and satisfying to use I would sacrifice the difficulty for the satisfaction. Despite the lack of difficulty, the gameplay loop and game feel is worth 70$ to me personally.\\n\\nThe story in this game is... an improvement from previous entries. The characters, cutscenes, and storyline are more involved and compelling than previous installments, but to be honest, I don\\'t think many people are playing monster hunter for a compelling story. unga bunga hammer go bonk, and all that\\n\\nOverall, the game feel is impeccable, and I will probably end up putting at least a couple hundred hours into it before its G/Master rank expansion releases in a couple years. Capcom has already promised half a dozen or more free title updates over the next year that will include new monsters and loads of event quests and other things to do in the game. For me at least, the $70 is worth it to satiate my addiction to this series.\\n\\n\\nNegatives-\\n\\nPerformance is really bad. I have a Ryzen 9 5950x and a 3090 and I am playing this game at 4k high, raytracing off and getting 45FPS. This is playable for me because I spent a decade playing on a 3ds outdoors at 20 fps, but understandably many people are not willing to play a 70$ game below 60fps or able to afford a PC capable of more than 30fps.\\n\\nOn top of the low framerates, graphical bugs are not uncommon either. I personally have experienced the \"black triangle\" 3 or 4 times in my 45 hours of gameplay, which causes a flashing black triangle to fill about a quarter of your screen for 20 seconds or so for no apparent reason, which makes the game almost unplayable while its happening.\\nI have also seen the \"PS2 graphics\" bug, where some models appear to have about 100 polygons like OG Final Fantasy 7. For me this happened once after fast travelling and it resolved itself after about 3 seconds. I personally have not experienced any game crashes (I\\'m on the latest version of Windows 11 with the latest graphics drivers).\\n\\nIn classic capcom fashion, the menus in this game are heinous. \\nin particular, setting up multiplayer is particularly problematic until you figure out the system, so I will explain what you need to do to get it working the way you expect it too:\\n\\nBasically, you want to have your friends in a lobby AND a link party at the same time.\\nThe lobby is basically how you can see your friends in the overworld, while a link party allows you to go on quests together as a group. you can go on quests together using either one, but for the best experience, you want both.\\nTo set it up:\\n1. you want one person to create a private lobby after selecting their save data on the home screen.\\n2. after loading in to the game, that player should get the lobby ID by going to the member list screen (start -> tab 4, labelled \"communication\" -> member list). The lobby ID will be displayed on the right. This player should send that lobby ID to everyone they want to play with.\\n3. The other players should select \"lobby search\" and then \"find a lobby based on ID\". (finding from in game or steam friends lists seems to have a 30% or less success rate, lobby ID works every time in my experience).\\n4. After loading in to the lobby, one player should go back to the member list mentioned before, and go to the \"lobby\" tab, then select and invite the other players to a link party.\\n5. The other players then need to accept the link party invite, either by holding the plus button on their controller after they receive the notification, or by going to start -> communication -> invites -> received invites.\\n\\nFrom here, players will be able to see eachother in the overworld (because they are in the same lobby) and will automatically be able to join quests the other players post (because of the link party). Keep in mind a private lobby can have 16 players but a link party is only 4, so your lobby can have 4 groups of 4. You can also join quests from outside a link party by talking to Alma, so you can do quests with anyone else in the lobby, its just less convenient. You can have a link party between players in different lobbies and a lobby with no link parties, but you probably want both.\\n\\nlastly, I personally found the music to be a little underwhelming compared to previous entries.\\n\\nNone of the negatives are severe enough to be a deal breaker to me, especially since most of them will (hopefully) be patched out.\\n\\nEDIT:\\n\\nAfter thinking about it a while last night, I realized that what really sets the old world games (everything before Monster hunter world) apart from the more recent ones is the feeling that you are really in an intense fight with a monster. I cant really put my finger on what makes that difference, but it has something to do with the players ability to move more freely in current games.  Old world games required a lot more intentionality and commitment to attacks because a poorly timed or spaced attack could cost a cart. I feel like I can get through basically any hunt in Wilds by mashing buttons on my controller while wielding a sword and shield, but I do look WAY cooler doing it in wilds than in any other game.\\n\\nPart of what I enjoy about monster hunter is the community aspect. Joining a random quest to get materials you need and finding people spamming stickers and gestures and having fun in post game is as relevant as the combat itself to me. Those kinds of interactions aren\\'t as accessible in old world games as they used to be (albiet not impossible to find).\\n\\nI\\'m playing with 2 different groups of friends so I am having fun helping them progress through the game while using my own time to do fashion hunting and grind materials for melding armor spheres and artian upgrades. Capcom added event quests and more weekly challenges today. Even if I don\\'t enjoy this game the same way I did old world games, I am still having a lot of fun playing it and it still feels like there is enough for me to do (although I wish there was more).\\n\\nWhile it doesn\\'t impact my review of this game at all, I would encourage anyone that enjoys wilds as their first monster hunter to play an old world game like Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate.\\n\\n\\nUpdate as of HR100/~60 hours in game:\\nI was at steam review character limit so I put it on reddit:\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1j7acuo/', 'timestamp_created': 1741081550, 'timestamp_updated': 1741535351, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 1400, 'votes_funny': 23, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.912997424602508545', 'comment_count': 76, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': False, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}\n",

Quite frankly, this launch is unacceptable. There\\'s no reason for my new rig with a 4070ti and a Ryzen 5 7600x should be struggling to hit 60fps at 1080p. It seems like they really want you to use frame generation on your first bootup as a magic bandaid, but that\\'s not how this works. Bad performance is bad performance. This alone would normally get me to give it a negative review.\\n\\nBut dammit, this game is so fun. It\\'s all I\\'ve been thinking about lately. In terms of the core gameplay, this is the best monster hunter has ever been. Everything feels good to use, every weapon is fun, every fight is cinematic, and every monster is diverse, and in my opinion, more interesting than the monsters in base world.\\n\\nThat being said, it\\'s not all fantastic. The other elephant in the room is the difficulty of the game, which has been a hot topic, and has been since World even. This was my experience: I played most of the game solo or with a buddy, and I honestly didn\\'t see much issue with the difficulty. I\\'m not a Monster Hunter expert, but I\\'m not a beginner either, so I expected low rank to be a pushover and it was, no problem with that. High rank saw a boost in difficulty, primarily with the Apex Predators, that I was happy with. Not too hard (which will come in master rank I\\'m sure) but not brain dead. I rarely carted throughout the game, but I also played previous Monster Hunters and still had to actually fight. From my memory this is about the experience I had in World as well. \\n\\nBut then I decided to play some 4-player SOS missions, and the dynamic changed entirely. Most monsters rarely attacked since they were constantly getting hammered, wounded, and stunned, including late monsters. World wasn\\'t entirely difficult either, but this slaughter wasn\\'t as common place even with 4 other players. It feels like the game was balanced for solo and duo play and not much else, the monster health is super low and the wound status rate is too high, which just creates scenarios where 4 players wail on the monster creating perpetual wounds. A big appeal of Monster Hunter is the multiplayer, which makes this a bit of a disappointment. Teaming up in Monster Hunter usually always makes it easier, but it really shouldn\\'t be this much of a leap to where hunts end almost as soon as you reach the monster. This WASN\\'T the case in World, I still felt like 4-player hunts were fun in that game even if it was a tad easier. \\n\\nIn general, multiplayer is the weak point of this. Needlessly complicated to even get into a game, in some cases even a downgrade from prior games in terms of accessibility. I don\\'t see the reason for the distinction between Lobbies, Link Groups, and Environment Links. It just seems overly complicated and poorly explained. And of course, the famous communication error makes a grand return.\\n\\nArena missions are missing as well, which is unfortunate. Some of my favorite memories of previous Monster Hunter games were teaming with a friend to get the best time with the pre-selected gear setups, but that aspect of the game is gone. Hopefully it makes a return in a future title update or in the Master Rank expansion. \\n\\nAnd then there\\'s some general gameplay changes, i.e. the Seikret mount, no monster tracking, easy escapes and heals. To be fair, most of these were introduced in Rise and were just brought back to this, but generally I don\\'t think they were needed and likelycontribute to the lack of challenge veterans are experiencing. Hunters and Palicoes have more tools now than ever before, but the monsters haven\\'t been buffed to match (yet) and it\\'s starting to show the divide. Again, low and high rank are all that\\'s available, so I can\\'t say whether this is necessarily good or bad yet, but I can\\'t deny some of the Monster Hunter identity seems to be lost. Tracking and searching may have been shallow, boring, and frustrating in the other entries, but it was a part of the charm of actually hunting the monster. You could argue with that gone you can get right to the good bit, which is the fights, but then it just ends up feeling like a boss rush game and less like a hunt, especially when \"prep-time\" feels like more of an afterthought now more than ever. \\n\\nThat being said, I have still thoroughly enjoyed my time with this game (and not done yet!) and think it\\'s still some of the best gameplay the series has to offer, which at the end of the day is what draws me in. This is the perfect starting point for a new hunter and has a lot to offer. Just keep in mind Monster Hunter is famous for confusing progression and menus, and just have fun with it without getting bogged down too much.

Wilds has such good designs and animations, which get severely neutered by the absolutely broken performance.\\n\\n[b]2. Multiplayer cohesion.[/b] It is miserable to have to re-join a quest, only after someone has actively started the hunting portion of the quest, when you have played along the exact same questline. Not only that, even if you\\'re playing in tandem, you have to ACTIVELY run away from the hunt you\\'re trying to complete together in order to even re-join your friends, since the game gives you a connection error if you get hit by the monster you were immediately forced to fight. It\\'s crazy that they managed to un-fix a problem I thought they\\'d resolved in other titles.\\n\\n[b]3. Pacing.[/b] Good lord, it\\'s miserable. Are you going to get a cutscene that forces you to leave the area immediately after a quest? Or maybe a dialogue sequence you have to skip through one message at a time? Or an unskippable auto-walk at the slowest possible movement rate on your seikret? After 2-4 of these, randomly chosen, you will be immediately thrust into a hunt that lasts all of 5 minutes. Repeat until the credits roll.\\n\\n[b]4.  Difficulty.[/b] Worlds and Rise both had significantly harder monsters than anything in Wilds. They have tiny health pools that make it so you barely engage a monster before it\\'s dead. Their attacks do negligable damage that is healed with 1 potion (or better yet by your palico which you no longer have any choices to make regarding their tools), and there\\'s no threatening follow-ups to the monster attacks on the off-chance they even get you low enough to care. Wounds spawn constantly, and borderline stunlock monsters when you proc them. I never, ever felt anything that could qualify as a challenge, not even on the final boss, and so I felt like I had to rush the game to even have a chance at enjoying any gameplay, because HOPEFULLY high-rank is a little less trivial.\\n\\n[b]5. Exploration.[/b] There is literally no reason to do any exploring, at all, ever. The closest you could get to an incentive would be for pop-up camp locations. Your seikret transports you to all but two destinations automatically, and the entire map and all of it\\'s resources are revealed. There\\'s no gameplay-driven reason to hunt for anything, and it is so sad because the artists put tremendous work into the scope and detail of the world, and the monsters, and the environments, and it all gets wasted because you\\'re never made to gather monster tracks, or do an expedition, or hunt for gathering spots.\\n\\nWhen you combine all of these factors, you get a game that feels like it\\'s trying to say [b]\"Hey, actually, please don\\'t engage with me until the postgame, because every single system I\\'m built on is working together to make the process of getting there nothing but a chore.\"[/b] It\\'s insane how many systems they discarded that validated the entire experience of Monster Hunter. God, I hope high-rank has some challenge to it at least. It\\'s unforgiveable how badly they designed this game in totality.

Remember the days when Gamespot gave Freedom Unite 5/10 for not having lock-on? Pepperidge farm remembers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this regard, MHWilds has, for better or worse, been dumbed down so hunters - veterans and newcomers alike - can have a stress-free experience to explore, hunt, and craft as we have all done before. Overall, the changes are welcome additions that make Wilds a unique experience in its own right, but as I assume most other veterans of the series probably do already, I also have a list of complaints to address. These issues are what compels me to still recommend MHW/Iceborne as the definitive MH experience over Wilds (at least for the time being). And sorry, but I\\'m not even looking at you this time, Rise. You\\'re third place no matter what.\\r\\n\\r\\n[h1]Positives[/h1]\\r\\n[b]Core Gameplay[/b]\\r\\nThe core gameplay always centered around the plethora of weapon styles and their mechanics. From Greatsword to Longsword, SnS to Dual Blades, Hammer to Hunting Horn, LBG to HBG, the choices are there for you to pick up and eventually master depending on how much time and effort you invest into each of them. Wilds added many new convenient features to each weapon; in my personal experience, I\\'ve been enjoying Charge Blade more than I ever have and it has replaced Longsword as my main weapon since the days of MHW/I. This time around, the game also allows you to swap weapons on the fly to a secondary while mounting your Seikret, a feature that seems less impactful than originally intended, but a convenient feature nonetheless, especially for those who are lazy to go into their tents every half hour. The exploration, gear/build crafting, fashion hunting: it\\'s all there. More of the same old same old, depending on how you look at it. And we\\'re all here for it.\\r\\n\\r\\n[b]Multiplayer & Questing[/b]\\r\\nThe lobbies and matchmaking in MHW/I were flawless in the first place. It wasn\\'t hard to join up with friends in the same lobby, queue up for a quest, and hunt together. I\\'ve seen opinions about Capcom dropping the ball and making matchmaking worse somehow in Wilds, but I don\\'t see it. The easy of access is still there, just not at first glance. The tradeoff, from what I can tell, is that they wanted us to always be roaming, always be seeing monsters everywhere we go without having to \"load in\" to an instance all the time. The quest queueing is still there, but the innovative option is easy to miss and give credit to. In terms of exploration, the only loading we have to go through is when we switch maps or queue into a quest (same as before), but we now also have the added feature of stepping out into a vast field of monsters right outside our doorstep. All in all, the tradeoff was worth it; wherever I am, I can step out onto an area of that map either on feet or on my Seikret and see a monster walking around - and I can hit. Beautiful, if you ask me. Almost - just almost - on par with Elden Ring levels of \"not taking us out of the immersion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[b]The Monsters[/b]\\r\\nThe bread and butter in some aspects of what defines a game in the series. Some may argue the monsters in Wilds aren\\'t as appealing as they could be, but the amount of effort put into their designs and fight patterns is admirable. They don\\'t seem as copy and pasty as I feared they would be, and we see many returning faces as well as newcomers. None of the patterns for the launch monsters seem broken or out of the ordinary either. Obviously, the community is looking forward to many more being added to the roster with updates, but the initial roster seems solid enough to keep us entertained. My only minor gripe is that some monsters lack an \"identity\" of their own, a factor which contributes to hunts feeling repetitive at times.\\r\\n\\r\\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\\r\\n[b]Repetitive Flow - For the first time ever[/b]\\r\\nAlthough the weapons feature numerous \"gimmicks\" and combos, along with unique focus attacks that provide a dopamine hit equivalent to successfully honing a weapon in Lost Ark (Dual Blades, thank you for letting me fly around like Levi, literally), this is the first MH title wherein I felt the combat became actually repetitive. The longer a hunt got, the more I found myself just wailing at a monster until it tired or fell. Don\\'t get me wrong, this feeling exists in every MH game, but it has never been more prominent than it has in Wilds. This is the primary reason I consider MHW/I to be the stronger contender for being the definitive MH experience over Wilds; in Wilds, most - if not all - hunts end up becoming a gruelfest where I hope the quest just ends soon. And what\\'s with all the monsters running away so many times? Arkveld runs away five or six times just because it runs out of breath or had its feelings hurt...\\r\\n\\r\\n[b]Items and Builds - Unnecessary?[/b]\\r\\nI have a confession. I have not once used a Demondrug or Armordrug yet, and I\\'m almost done with the core game. I also have not eaten a meal before every quest. Is the game designed so hunts can be just as quick without proper preparation? I honestly miss the days when I would have the step-by-step process so engulfed into my brain as second nature: tent -> pick build loadout -> pick item loadout/restock -> eat at canteen -> load into hunt -> pop demondrug/armordrug/seeds -> choose pod -> jump down into Nergigante in Origin Isle -> rinse and repeat. These were staples in previous titles, so what happened? Slotting in decorations and optimizing builds seem fun at first, but I don\\'t really see them contributing to cutting down my hunt times as much as they used to. Maybe this will change once elder dragons come into the picture.\\r\\n\\r\\n[b]Lack of Central Hub[/b]\\r\\nThe number of times I had to google the location of a NPC I was already familiar with is proof that we need a gathering hub with all the NPCs lined up with their names and job description highlighted above their heads. That is all. Looking forward to it in the next free title update, Capcom!\\r\\n\\r\\n[b]Bland Story[/b]\\r\\nIf I don\\'t mention this category, I\\'m afraid I\\'ll be misunderstood as having liked the story. No. Not at all. However, I do acknowledge that I was never a Monster Hunter fan for their storytelling or quality cutscenes showing me how many lives I changed by hunting down monsters. That being said, the only parts I enjoyed about the story in MHWilds is whenever Alma gave me authorization to hunt a monster and I would respond with \"Acknowledged\" and walked like the baddest mf on the planet. That was... cool.\\r\\n\\r\\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\\r\\n[b]Final Verdict: 8/10 B[/b]\\r\\nAlthough the core gameplay is there and the game is solid so far, MHWilds isn\\'t a game I would recommend over MHW/I in its current state. As I mentioned in the preface, Wilds is more of the same in this humble veteran\\'s eyes, and you can sit comfortably in front of your screen and take heart in knowing that even if you don\\'t buy it now, the game isn\\'t going anywhere. The $70 starting price point is also no laughing matter, so newcomers should avoid falling into the \"gotta play the new game\" trap and tackle MHW/I first if you haven\\'t tried it yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetter yet, when you do come to Wilds one day, the game will more than likely have all the future updates available at your whim. The only thing potentially missing will be the influx of players to hunt with, but we all know there will always be hunters at your disposal. One final note in that regard: aside from the achievement that requires online hunting, I still prefer to solo everything without any issue just because I want get those focus attacks in without interruption. Who knows?

I have 3000+ hours across the recent titles. I played World/Iceborne on Playstation and then PC over again when the PC versions launched. I did the same for Rise/Sunbreak.\\r\\n\\r\\nI want to preface that I\\'ve finished the main story & beaten every monster the game has to offer. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis game, wholeheartedly, is a downgrade in almost every aspect when compared to the previous titles. It\\'s \"OK\" - but there\\'s a lot of things that are just... bad decisions. They\\'ll sell \"fixes\" through an expansion, like they did with Rise, but it\\'s still NOT GOOD in the current state.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe lost SO many quality of life changes.\\r\\n---------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGraphical downgrade and terrible optimization. The game looks brown. Everything looks brown. There\\'s filters/settings enabled that just makes it look *bad* - Sometimes, like in the lush forest, it looks incredible when the fog is off... but everywhere else it looks washed out. The FPS is awful (There\\'s a typo in the config file you can fix to add a little more) and you will struggle to get over 60 FPS on average/decent computers.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo idea what happened in testing.\\r\\n\\r\\n---------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\nMultiplayer is terribly implemented. There\\'s lobbies, link parties, environment links, and a billion other things you need to juggle just to play with people. We seriously went from >make lobby >join lobby >post quests and play... to whatever this is. Even if you\\'re IN THE ENVIRONMENT LINK WITH FRIENDS you still get disconnected sometimes after defeating a single monster. It makes no sense. \\r\\n\\r\\nYou\\'re forced into \\'cutscene gates\\' where you can\\'t do things with people until you see certain things.. something that was FIXED in World because it was SO HATED AND ANNOYING. It\\'s back! Playing with friends is ROUGH until you\\'re at the end of the game.\\r\\n\\r\\n---------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game is incredibly theme-parky and ACTIVELY DISCOURAGES exploration. You are tethered to certain areas while doing any story mode missions. World encouraged vertical exploration and players to go around on their own, but on here everything is listed, shown, and auto-pathed to by your mount. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no central hub, so it feels like you\\'re constantly jumping around \"exhibits\" to find NPC\\'s, quests, turn things in, and do whatever. It\\'s very broken up, sparse, and feels incredibly clunky and jarring to navigate compared to the previous two titles (and even older ones). I guess they\\'re adding a central hub eventually but didn\\'t have enough time? Sucks.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt feels like they took Frontiers and mutilated it, trying to have an \"MMO FEEL\" without any MMO mechanics. I cannot tell you the number of times I\\'ve had to look everywhere to find where to turn in quests. \\r\\n\\r\\nEven things like MAP MARKERS for camps are buried by other markers IN CAMPS and they\\'re really difficult to see/fast travel to. The way the list of camps were shown in World made it *brain dead easy* to find... How did we go to this?\\r\\n\\r\\n---------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story is very bland. I\\'d even say that it\\'s awful. I won\\'t go into spoilers or specifics, but there\\'s absolutely no \"big catastrophe\" you\\'re trying to avert or anything major that\\'s being built up to. \\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the dialogue is patronizing, condescending, or very \"life is special\" - and it just rings really hokey. There\\'s also not even a dragonator anywhere in the entire game. I\\'d put it on the same level as \"base\" Rise\\'s story, which says a lot.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s very few memorable characters, moments, or anything along those lines. Part of what makes some of the story of the previous titles so good is how extra and over the top some of the characters are. Again, no dragonator moments.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt can also be completed in less than 10 hours without rushing. It just kinda.. ends.\\r\\n\\r\\n---------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\nThe experience feels soulless. I dunno how else to put it other than feeling like nothing is inspired, and more like everything was \"lets do this again\" in Wilds. It feels like there was no vision beyond \"Make another World game\" and Capcom executives yelling at the developers to do so. The phrase I\\'ve heard a LOT of friends using (who are veterans of MH far longer than I am, since the original) is that it feels *incredibly* corporate.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou kinda just get it as a vibe. As you play through, the longer you play through, you\\'ll understand what I mean.\\r\\n\\r\\n---------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\nMonster variety is very limited, and there\\'s nothing really \"stand out\". Even the flagship monster is uninspired compared to previous title flagship monsters. Going through the entire game, killing every single monster available, I cannot think of a single one that impressed me or made me go \"woah\" on the same level of things like Vaal Hazak, Velkhana, Malzeno, Xeno\\'Jiiva, etc had to offer. It feels like you\\'re fighting three archetypes the entire game.\\r\\n\\r\\nA lot of monsters are repeats from previous games, including the movesets and skeletons (which have been used on a few of the new ones), which is a bit disappointing considering how few actually exist.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m actually worried about future content because most of the announced monsters are just filler/mid tier monsters... and the game\\'s already done. The escalation wont be there unless they add things like Alatreon, etc, alongside smaller threats.\\r\\n\\r\\n---------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s no endgame. You farm two or three tempered monsters at the end and that\\'s it. There\\'s no carrot on a stick to pursue and you\\'ll be done as a dedicated player within a few days.  I won\\'t go into extreme detail but yeah, nada.\\r\\n\\r\\n---------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\nDecorations are really weird now. Most attack based ones can only be put on weapons (Such as ballistics, etc), which means only 3 slot weapons can fit them. Three slot slots on armor/etc CANNOT wear the same decorations as weapons. This severely limits builds. Most armor sets also are just *incredibly* lackluster when it comes to skills provided.\\r\\n\\r\\nI get this limits player power but.. it just feels really clunky on how they did it.\\r\\n\\r\\n---------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entire new wound system is just clutch claw from Iceborne but way more auto-pilot. You do huge amounts of damage while wounding, get free materials, and CONSTANTLY KNOCK DOWN MONSTERS from applying wounds. There\\'s fights you\\'re going to do later once you\\'re geared where monsters cannot get up off of the ground. \\r\\n\\r\\nPeople complained about the clutch-claw gameplay and this is just the exact thing.. but WAY more  overtuned and broken. Even the hardest monsters the game has to offer kinda get destroyed by any sort of wound mechanic.\\r\\n\\r\\n---------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\nThe food system is a downgrade. I get what they were going for but in simplifying it they\\'ve made it kinda awful. Getting materials sucks, the stores that sell/offer ingredients only seem to give you rations, and the bonuses from food are lackluster. We went from having major defense up, attack up, ammo conservation, and all these other awesome things to just basic buffs. \\r\\n\\r\\nNOT TO MENTION THERE\\'S NO PALICO CUTSCENES FOR FOOD COOKING. RIP Grandma food cat.\\r\\n\\r\\n---------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\nThe camera is awful. Monsters are bigger than your screen and tracking is bad. Can\\'t count the number of times later that bigger monsters are just 95% of your screen and you can\\'t see what they\\'re doing fast enough. Even at max zoom/focus it\\'s a downgrade from World.\\r\\n\\r\\n---------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\nI *want* this game to be better than it is and I know they\\'ll make it better in the future, but man, I wouldn\\'t be surprised if I see lots of people going back to play World/Iceborne after a couple of weeks of Wilds.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonster Hunter fans will still find enjoyment in the game but the entire way through you\\'ll probably be thinking \"I miss this\" or \"This is clunky\" or \"This was done better\" - and that\\'s just sad to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n', 'timestamp_created': 1740895411, 'timestamp_updated': 1740895411, 'voted_up': False, 'votes_up': 3643, 'votes_funny': 83, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.785693526268005371', 'comment_count': 246, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': False, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}\n",

I assume this is to encourage shark card sales. (To be fair the recent updates have improved upon this aspect a lot.)\\n-Patching dozens of harmless clothing glitches.\\n-Recently removing text chat in the enhanced version.\\n-In general they don’t listen to what the community has to say.\\n\\n-Overall poor balancing of the game that forces players to only really be able to use a handful of overpowered vehicles.\\n     -Explosive sniper making planes and helicopters unusable\\n     -Railgun making helicopters unusable (with no drawbacks)\\n     -lock on jammers making griefers harder to kill\\n     -The raiju at the moment has too much armour and speed meaning anyone can escape any situation by tanking a few \\n      shots and flying in a straight line (This is the only jet you see in the sky lately)\\n     -Heist warping has been able to be abused in pvp for way too long at this point\\n     -It’s unbelievable that the orbital cannon is even in the game, I personally don’t mind it too much since it can be countered \\n      sometimes and has a large cooldown but it really shouldn’t exist.\\n     -Big planes in general are unusable (except for the avenger) since they can be taken down VERY easily by most things (Planes, \\n      helicopters, explo sniper, railgun, mk2, deluxo ect.)\\n\\nOverall from what i’ve listed here, players are forced into using only the best tools they have available, the railgun to destroy any vehicles that attack them, the mk2 is the only thing close to safe from the railgun aside from armoured vehicles.  Armoured vehicles, work well as a defensive tool for those not into pvp but in the hands of griefers they’re near unbeatable.\\n\\nWhat all of this has in common is that it looks like their goal is to make as much money as possible. If the player keeps dying to unfair shit they’ll probably buy a shark card so they can get a mk2. It really doesn’t make sense to me because if they care so much about making money why would they not care about what the community wants. They would bring in more players and said players would purchase a wider variety of weapons and vehicles in turn spending more money on the game.\\n\\nJust a minor personal complaint to finish off, whenever I come across a minor but extremely annoying aspect of the game, such as getting stuck in the clouds, getting black screened when entering buildings, long loading times when entering buildings, chat just not working sometimes in legacy, calling mors mutual just not working sometimes, ect.

Because there is literally no viable competition. Please, please, someone make a decent soccer video game so I don't have to give EA any more money.\\n\\nIn all honesty, EA FC isn't a terrible video game. It has several positive aspects. The graphics are passable. The gameplay, while it hasn't evolved meaningfully in a long time, is still very satisfying. They have the licenses for pretty much any team/league you may be interested in (that's the most important part). No other game really meets these expectations. eFootball is truly bad, I gave it an honest try. That makes EA FC the only viable AAA soccer game being developed anymore.\\n\\nHowever, here is a list of why I hate buying EA FC:\\n\\n[list]\\n    [*]Yearly release, 95% of the game is recycled every time. Nothing new to see here folks. This year has a lot of new tactics options, but that's much more of a DLC IMO. A brand new game every year for a roster update and what amounts to a title update or maybe DLC.\\n    [*]Terrible optimization. The graphics are pretty good for a sports game, as I mentioned. But using 100% GPU on a 7900xt and only getting like 120 FPS in many cases is crazy. I should be hitting 240 without even using 100% GPU. Much better looking games max out my refresh rate. This a game about a physical sport that tries to foster an esports community. It is absolutely not optimized or stable enough for competitive esports.\\n    [*]EA launcher is a requirement, and it causes unnecessary issues. They have tried to hide it by having it launch before the game and then close when you exit the game. This is admittedly an improvement, but it makes the game take longer to launch than necessary and sometimes, like right now, it is prompting to activate (again) and then just crashing. So while I'm typing this I am locked out of a game that I paid for by overly-aggressive and UNNECESSARY DRM.\\n    [*]General bugs and glitches. It is amazing how often a bug impacts my ability to play and enjoy this game. People joke about Bethesda or CD Projekt, but they have nothing on FIFA/EA FC. This is basically the same game every year. How are there so many bugs that carry over to the new version? Why does it launch in a tiny window that I have to maximize every time? Why do my saved settings occasionally get burnt and have to be totally redone?\\n    [*]Better game modes have been ignored for a long time so they can milk their cash cow, Ultimate Team. Maybe it's just because I'm getting older, but Ultimate Team is boring, confusing, and feels predatory. I just want to play career mode and multiplayer seasons. These modes have been pretty stale for a while.\\n    [*]Intentionally broken WINE/Proton compatibility, for no good reason. One of the reasons I keep a Windows partition, just in case I want to play this game.\\n[/list]\\n\\nIf you are really into video games and soccer/football, EA FC is still a no-brainer purchase every few years on sale. But only because there is nothing else out there!

Despite what you'd expect, the Ray Tracing implementation is probably one of the least-intensive new features, and yet seems to be exceedingly good in that it demonstrates an understanding that it is best used sparingly for a gentle injection of realism rather than absolute perfect mathematical duplication of light ray pathing that tanks any but the most expensive computers. Reflections look nicer, shadows in the world feel more realistic, reflected light from coloured surfaces colours other surfaces...they've used the technology to add little touches of flavour, which makes it run much better than it otherwise might. The overall effect is, in my opinion, better than Ray Tracing in games like Cyberpunk because the small touches offer noticeable but realistically subtle improvements to the world without having to show themselves off, while decent performance allows it to be accessible to most players. \\n\\nThat said, it's still  the same game - a spacious, but vacuous and utterly misguided affair. The rose-tinted glasses most certainly come off after your first playthrough, let alone 12 years after release. The missions vary wildly in quality, but are largely a boring, linear slog. You will spend far too much time all throughout the game observing the rubber-banding of the vehicle you're supposed to be chasing as the game urges you to 'catch this person', when it knows full well that you'll only catch them at the exact scripted moment. Races are always rigged to be too easy because they're not that interesting, and you'd be hard-pressed to want to repeat them if they were harder. The world is intensely detailed on a macro level, and a cardboard cutout on the player-level. The shop directly across from Franklin's house is a good example of a movie-set facade that you're supposed to drive by and not notice, yet it's placed directly in front of one of your most visited locations. It  feels like you should be able to enter it, and yet it's one layer away from being a single 'store interior' texture slapped on the outside wall and stands out like a sore thumb. On every level, attempts to interact with the massive map are as fulfilling as staring at a concrete wall with a pretty field painted on it and trying to smell the flowers. There are next to no activities to do of any real worth beyond the main missions - you can go to a car wash, or sit and watch cutscenes of your character talking to a therapist, or invite a 'friend' to ride a ferris wheel. You can go to the cinema and watch a bunch of short films that are all produced with the same 'subtle as a sledgehammer' tone as the gratingly unfunny radio ads. None of these activities are entertaining or impactful to your experience, and the more fidelity Rockstar gives its worlds, the more lazy and facilie its satire appears, and the more starkly its lack of interactivity stands out. \\n\\nThe distance makes driving from one location to another a chore, and venturing to the entire other side of the world only offers more mechanically tedious minigames, plastic pedestrians, buildings you can't go into, and police that will track your exact location right up until the allotted amount of time in hiding has passed. The main characters are all unrelatable and unlikable. Michael is a clueless, angry loser. Franklin whines relentlessly about every single person he knows. Trevor is, now more than ever, an absolute mistake as a protagonist - a punishment for players who do the things the game encourages them to do, disguised as self-awareness. Like all GTA V's attempts at saying something meaningful, Trevor's playability, and most missions in which you take control of him make the game less fun at the same time as they fail in their superficial messaging. If he were a mirror for the player then you might be inclined to reflect on your behaviour and not be like him, but you can't not be like him because you *are* him. Not one character in the game offers any hope for personal growth or has any meaningful goals other than 'get money'. Every single side character is an irredeemable annoyance. The sole concept is that America - and LA specifically - are sh*tholes that turn their inhabitants into miserable creatures. But I wonder if, at any point, the Housers considered that playing as miserable people whose only aspiration was to sit higher up on the pile of turds might not be very fun or interesting? Switching between three characters makes it feel like you're constantly being forced away from whichever one you can tolerate the most to fart about as someone else until the game offers you nothing else to do unless you switch characters again. And eventually the story ends and you're left stuck in the box with a bunch of cash and nothing to do with it, because without the main missions the world of GTA V becomes completely inert.\\n\\nGTA V is, in my opinion, the most fundamentally flawed and empty of all the mainline games. I'd argue that it has the least interest in allowing players to indulge the location, with GTA IV being a close second, but this game's story is less focused, less compelling, and the characters you play as aren't really worth rooting for. It made a huge splash because it was a new GTA (at the time), it was a next gen GTA (at the time), and it was viewed as a technical achievement (at the time) because of its size and scale, before everyone clued into the fact that bigger worlds are actually boring as hell and a smaller, more condensed environment with a distilled personality and more interactivity was a far more enjoyable experience. I went to Grove Street and found a note in Ryder's back yard - 1 of 50. How in the hell am I supposed to locate 49 other needles in an 80sq/km haystack? Why would I care to? \\n\\nLastly, I suppose the Online portion of the game was a fun novelty for a while before it became a Horseman of the Apocalypse for depraved, exploitative monetisation. This novel gamemode is now generally regarded as a slop trough casino for the publisher as they wring the most vulnerable, addictable personalities amongst their player base dry, pouring cash better spent elsewhere into the slavering maws of corporate executive hogs that use that exact revenue stream as an excuse to not create new stories. It's pathetic.\\n\\nIf you already own the game, then this review means nothing. Is it worth a buy in 2025 for someone who hasn't yet played it? Nah. GTA IV is a better story with better characters in a world relatively on-par in terms of how interesting it can be.

or wait until you switch sides between defense/attack as the shop resets at that point). now, they give you the ability to choose a weapon of a specific category (shotgun, smg, rifle) two times per game/side and it is not limited to a SPECIFIC weapon, you have two uses for each category (so if you prefer the fever over discipline, you can use it twice without having to request it)\\n- overall, the fact that each round is different from the other based on the cards the team chooses is just such a good concept, and i find it harder to get bored or burnt out\\n- also, according to the devs, once you buy the battlepass, you keep it forever. so sort of like the rivals bp system which is cool\\n\\ncons:\\n- i don't have a lot to mention here, but i guess since it's something that people have mentioned already, the movement speed change can be an issue for people that have played the game previously. i would say that this would definitely not be a problem for new players though. (i think that if they revert it back to the old movement, newer players might have trouble with it haha, you can never make everyone happy imo)\\n- people have had issues with receiving closed beta rewards, but i believe this is something that the devs will try to find a solution for\\n- i've heard that currently ranked is a bit messy, the queue is long and since there's not much balance, it can be difficult because it's filled with players that were previously in top ranks. (i would say this isn't really a con though, as at the moment the game has not even been released for 24 hours and not a lot of people have reached level 30 to be able to queue ranked, which means it will simply take a while before it is genuinely playable, but this is not something we haven't seen in other games before)\\n- servers/network issues. i have only experienced these like once or twice though, so i can't have much of an opinion on this, but i have seen people mentioning them. for me personally, it wasn't something that affected my experience too much.\\n\\n\\nhopefully this reaches people that are genuinely interested in the game and that aren't easily swayed by the negative reviews that have been posted so far!\\n\\nthere is no better way to judge something than to try it yourself :)\", 'timestamp_created': 1741340166, 'timestamp_updated': 1741383242, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 3, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.525862038135528564', 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': False, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}\n",

[/h1]\\n\\nAnd unlike many people, I don\\'t use that word often, if at all. Only a few games truly deserve such praise in my opinion. So when I say KCD2 is one of them, then you can be sure I was truly impressed by what I saw. KCD2 is basically KCD1, but 5 times better. That\\'s why you can refer to my KCD1 review and multiply every positive I pointed out by at least two. Everything is bigger, better and more entertaining than before. Steam forces me to cut every review in half every time I want to praise or criticize a game, so I\\'ll try to be as brief as possible, although this games deserves at least an essay on how great it is.\\n\\n[h3] Story [/h3]\\n\\nOne of the greatest improvements I\\'ve seen. KCD1\\'s story was decent, but it was mostly just... there. It did what was necessary, provided what was needed and wasn\\'t filled with logical errors and stupid discrepancies. It wasn\\'t something to write home about though. But now? Now we have a proper great story to rival and surpass many other of my beloved games. Absolutely no spoilers here though. You have to experience it for yourself. You\\'ll love these characters, dialogues and overall storytelling.\\n\\n[h3] Role-playing [/h3]\\n\\nAnother greatly improved aspect. There are so many ways to finish [i] most [/i] quests that even giving one as an example would eat all the space I have here. You can talk your way out of things, you can sneak, you can fight, yada yada yada, all that other RPG stuff (true RPG, not starfield, veilguard or elden ring). But there are also soooo many details and non-obvious ways to finish most of the quests, it honestly stunned me, and it still does. It looks as if the developers thought of almost everything, so if you use your imagination and deviate from the given objective while using logic, more often than not you will find that Warhorse have thought of that, and such things can even influence dialogues during this and further quests. NPCs remember what you did, they comment on it, they comment on what you do, how you act, how you\\'re dressed, are you smelly or drunk, etc. TES games had things like that, but they pale in comparison honestly.\\n\\n[h3] Music [/h3]\\n\\nAnother great improvement. KCD1\\'s was decent. KCD2\\'s is great.\\n\\n[h3] Combat [/h3]\\n\\nYou guessed it, another big upgrade. It\\'s smooth, it\\'s not frustrating, it\\'s easy. Honestly, too easy for my taste. Master Strike once again solves everything. Maybe Hardcore will fix it, but I didn\\'t like KCD1\\'s Hardcore, so I\\'m not holding my breath. But even like that it\\'s still highly enjoyable, and you [i] can [/i] lose if you\\'re too cocky. Also, only swords have Master Strike now, so that\\'s something. Turning off indicators is a fun way to make things more spicy, but I had to use a mod for that.\\n\\n[h3] Open world [/h3]\\n\\nYep. Again. Another big step-up. Just riding through the forest is interesting in this game, and this is the greatest praise I can think of. Games like Witcher or Bethesda games rely heavily on POIs such as caves, castles, monster lairs, etc. Almost none of that here. Does this make exploration boring? It doesn\\'t. Because so many space that would be empty in any other game is filled with random encounters (the best I\\'ve seen in games so far too) and neat little discoveries that are also sometimes referenced by NPCs, but play no real role in quests.\\n\\nOne example here: there was this wine merchant\\'s wagon I found that crashed near a small river. I took some wine for myself and left. 10-15 hours later I was tasked with tracking down some bandits, and one NPC said that I can find them near said wagon. Since I already knew where it was, it was easier for me to navigate and find those bandits. This will be even cooler when Hardcore is released, because such landmarks will help you find things when you can\\'t see your position on the map. This was neat in KCD1 as well, but here it\\'s much more detailed, and almost every NPC during most quests will give you clear enough instructions to find things you\\'re looking for without relying on a map or even compass.\\n\\n[h3] Interface [/h3]\\n\\nDidn\\'t think I\\'d praise something so trivial, but here we are. The only other game I can think of that impressed me with it\\'s unique interface was Persona 5. Here, it\\'s also uniquely stylish and authentic. It was also improved from a practical point of view, you can access your horse\\'s inventory from the same place as you own, for example. \\n\\n[h3] Graphics [/h3]\\n\\nAlso not something I praise often, but holy moly, this game is absolutely beautiful (and well-optimized!). I fully expected it to be just like KCD1, maybe slightly better. But it surpassed every expectation I had. It\\'s at least as beautiful as RDR2 (kinda sad that a 2018 game is the one I\\'m comparing this one to, as most new games are far laggier, and at the same time far-far uglier and technically inferior to RDR2).\\n\\n[h3] Issues [/h3]\\n\\nSurprisingly, almost none. I had a few bugs, but 95% of them were visual. No broken quests. The only big issue was when I needed to chase an NPC, but didn\\'t have the best horse, so I had to try ~20-30 times before I actually caught up with him. If my horse was at least a little bit slower, I\\'d have to reload an earlier save and find a faster horse to be sure. This was a story quest too, so bummer. Still, I caught the guy, so that\\'s something. I just wish it wasn\\'t a flat out \"You lost\" screen when I failed, but rather an alternative development for the quest, as is the case in many other quests, but oh well, can\\'t have everything.\\n\\nOther than that, the game has some minor issues, but that\\'s all they are. Minor and negligible.\\n\\nI\\'d also like to point out that realism in this game is not that tedious. Many people criticized RDR2 for such things, but I honestly think that RDR2 is more tedious than KCD2 in this regard. Almost no 10 minute horse riding, easy access to fast travel, animations aren\\'t as slow. It\\'s also much easier to access Savior Schnapps than in the first game, as well as food. It may not be for everyone, but I\\'d say that it should not stop you from trying the game if that\\'s what you\\'re afraid of. And if that\\'s still an issue... mods exist. Don\\'t like to rely on them to make the game playable, but it\\'s not like that. The game is fully playable for a casual player, far more than KCD1 was. It\\'s just extremely easy to install mods, so just know that you have that option.\\n\\n[h3] Summary [/h3]\\n\\nThis is a great game, and one of the greatest RPGs I\\'ve played in a long while. It may not be for everyone, and that\\'s a good thing. More games should be \"not for everyone\". This is what AAA games are supposed to be. What every miserable small indie company like ubisoft wishes to have. A game with soul, made by people who love their work, people who have something to say and show. This is probably not only my Game of the year, but rather \"Game of the last 4 years\", since the last time I fell in love with a game this much was when Ghost of Tsushima released, and when I played Persona 5.\\n\\nAlso, much love to Tom McKay and Luke Dale. Not only are they great and passionate voice actors, but great human beings as well, and I love every moment of their presence in-game, on social media and in game-related materials. I love these guys <3\\n\\nNow come on, you peasants. Your father\\'s sword won\\'t retrieve itself! [b] To the task!

It had a gripping story, an immersive open world, and a memorable cast of characters. KCD2 takes all of that and improves upon it in almost every way. This game is close to masterpiece. Close.\\r\\n\\r\\nKCD2 is a fantastic open-world RPG packed with content, making it well worth the price. In an industry flooded with half-baked releases, this game stands alongside the best of the past decade, proving that passion and quality still matter. While it has flaws-some of which I\\'ll discuss-they don\\'t ruin the experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bad:\\r\\nStealth - As someone who isn\\'t overly fond of stealth mechanics, I found KCD2 relies on them far more than its predecessor-and they\\'re not well-implemented. Several missions force you into stealth with no alternatives, breaking the roleplaying experience. There are too many of these sections, and they often feel frustrating rather than rewarding.\\r\\nHenry - I found Henry far more irritating in this game, which is a problem considering he\\'s the protagonist. There are multiple instances where his dialogue and actions are scripted, regardless of your playstyle. The game seems intent on steering him down a \"righteous\" path, even if you prefer a more ruthless or pragmatic approach. Personally, I enjoyed playing a rogue Henry pillaging, killing, and following orders, no matter how brutal but the game constantly nudges you toward being the noble hero. On top of that, Henry can be downright idiotic at times.\\r\\nThe Saving System - This was a major issue in the first game, and it\\'s just as frustrating here. A game with frequent stealth sections should not have a restrictive save system. Being forced to redo long sequences because you can\\'t save freely is infuriating. PC players can fix this with mods, but console players are out of luck.\\r\\nArchery - If you enjoyed using bows in KCD1, prepare for disappointment. Archery has been massively downgraded. It feels clunky, imprecise, and practically useless. The game clearly pushes you toward crossbows or, worse, those awful pistols.\\r\\nNo Theresa - This is a huge loss. Theresa was the heart and soul of the first game, yet here she\\'s only briefly mentioned. While characters like Katherine and Rosa are great, none of them fill the void she left.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Good:\\r\\nVisuals - If you thought KCD1 looked great, KCD2 blows it out of the water. The environmental detail is stunning-no game does trees, foliage, and landscapes quite like this one. The world feels alive, and the lighting is breathtaking. Watching the sunrise paint the hills in golden hues is a sight to behold. Character models are mostly well done, though a few faces are clearly copy-pasted.\\r\\nLength & Content - The main story alone took me 60 hours, and that\\'s without touching the many side missions. If you dive into everything, this is easily a 200+ hour experience. Add in the RPG elements that shape the story, and you\\'re looking at over 300 hours of gameplay. This is what RPGs should be-massive, immersive, and rewarding. Why would anyone spend £60+ on a game they can complete in 10 hours?\\r\\nCharacters - Aside from Henry, every character in KCD2 is fantastic. Your group of misfit friends, Hans, even the minor NPCs-they all feel distinct and well-written. I do wish Radzig and Hanush had bigger roles (they\\'re basically cameos), and Divish is notably absent. That said, the cast is excellent. Also, Godwin is back, and is a major character too. It\\'s good to have him.\\r\\nThe Story - The biggest improvement over the first game. While KCD1 had a strong narrative, KCD2 takes it to another level. The story flows beautifully, with cinematic pacing and excellent dialogue. There are some truly standout moments that make it feel like a high-quality TV series or film.\\r\\nMusic - Just like the first game, the soundtrack is cinematic and brilliant.\\r\\nCinematics - The cutscenes in this game go hard. Seriously, if you stitched them together, you\\'d have an incredible movie. The direction and presentation are outstanding.\\r\\nPolish - I can\\'t speak for the console, or low-end PC performance, but on my high-end PC, the game runs beautifully. I encountered very few bugs. memory leaks and no game-breaking issues. Compared to the first game\\'s, this is a massive improvement.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinal Thoughts:\\r\\nKCD2 is a brilliant RPG and will likely be one of the best games of the year. Of course, bigger releases are on the horizon such as GTA VI, but this has set a high bar. Think Skyrim meets RDR 2 meets The Witcher 3 all wrapped up in a package that\\'s both polished and well optimized. This game is amazing and feels like the antithesis of the usual AAA slop and respects you as the player by letting you think for yourself and grow with Henry.\\r\\nAs for the so-called \"controversial themes\" people keep talking about online-they\\'re barely present. There are no forced LGBT moments, and anyone claiming otherwise hasn\\'t played the game. They\\'re lying. The inclusion of diverse characters is handled naturally, and Henry\\'s reaction to meeting someone different from him is actually quite fitting for the time period. Complaints about this are just noise. I kinda like how Musa potrayed in this game. Especially during this Ramadhan 2025.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the day, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is an easy 9/10. I do hope the devs fix some of its issues there are more than I listed here, but I didn\\'t want this review to turn into a novel. I\\'m also looking forward to the DLCs and expansions. This world still has so many stories left to tell, and I sincerely hope this isn\\'t the last we see of Kingdom Come.

Everything just feels real, and I had so much fun just exploring the map, seeing everyday life in 15th century Bohemia. Even simple villages in the countryside have so much tiny details and practically every village is unique and different. \\n\\nThe other strength of the game is the freedom of choice you have. You can decide almost everything with diplomacy, violence or thievery, but also a lot of the time the NPCs and quests will acknowledge if you\\'ve completed the required objective (like, say, acquiring a quest-related item before you were told, or dealing with a group of bandits beforehand). Similarly, there are a lot of reactions to your character\\'s current looks and attributes. NPCs will react if you\\'re dirty, covered in blood, not wearing any clothes, even wearing stolen clothes.\\n\\nThere\\'s a lot more I can praise, like the writing, the visual design, the music, but I\\'d also like to mention a few criticisms that will probably really affect a new player\\'s overall enjoyment. \\n\\nFirst off, the combat. Enemies are still way too good at countering you, from the very first fight in the game, which results in a very weird difficulty curve where the beginning is brutally hard but once you unlock Master Strike and get some perks going, you\\'re unbeatable. There is very little reason to use any melee weapon besides swords. Making master-strike a sword exclusive and limiting the angle of attack for non-swords just seems like a very weird decisions that limits your options in a game where you\\'re already doing the same thing for 90% of the time.\\n\\nThe other big issue I have is the pacing of the game. A lot of the story missions are extremely linear and can railroad you for hours, which is a stark contrast with the open-world freedom you have for most of the playtime. And honestly, some parts just suck from a gameplay perspective (I am NOT looking forward to serving wine for 30 minutes again on a second playthrough). I also did not enjoy a lot of the \"follow NPC that delivers exposition\" moments and wish more of them had the option to skip forward to the actual gameplay. \\n\\nLastly, the crime system in this game is a bit weird and doesn\\'t always seem to make sense, but I dont know if this is a bug or the devs are trying to emulate how unfair the medieval legal system would be for a low-born peasant. I was accused of murder despite only ever killing bandits who attack me first and that soured my whole experience a bit.\\n\\nI know I wrote more negative stuff than praise, but I really love the game and hope those criticisms will be addressed somehow to make the game even better.

The very beginning made me think it would be a disappointment since it is not nearly as strong as the first game\\'s intro, but it just kept getting better and more interesting that by the end it even exceeded my expectations. Such an awesome story with great characters that I cared about. Mass Effect levels of intrigue where I was interested in exploring every single dialogue option to learn as much as I can.\\nSimilar to how everyone had very high expectations for Half Life Alyx and Valve not only met those but perhaps even exceeded them, I am glad to see such a feat is also achieved by KCD 2.\\nMaybe I shouldn\\'t be talking about other games but the point is, this is up there with the greatest games of all time just in my opinion, like the first game. I think this is the only franchise that has more than 1 game in my personal top favourite gaming experiences.\\nFirstly, the game looks so real but runs so well, I think more games should be made with Crytek engine. Scenery is so beautiful I chose to ride the horse to quest locations instead of fast travelling most of the time.\\nThe combat has been simplified significantly, 1v1 fights quickly became a breeze for me having played so much of the first game, but fighting multiple enemies by yourself is now something you can succeed at. It was disappointing for me to see the options for attacking from the lower left and lower right removed but the combat is still really fun, even despite the weapons being true to their archaic nature.\\nI got the achievement for doing most of the game\\'s content when I was about 3-quarters through the main quest and I can say all the side quests are interesting, some even funny. There are a lot of comedic moments in this game and not even just from the quests and characters but also from NPC behaviour. When NPCs argue and you stop to watch they will start bashing each other while shouting funny banter, during one such instance a guard also came to the fight, backed out and said something like \"I don\\'t want to deal with this, it\\'s the end of my shift\". I also witnessed a guard stop someone at one of the Kuttenberg entrances and asked for payment to enter just because that guy had beat him at dice.\\nIf you lock pick a door while sneaking around and leave it open, and a guard sees, they will comment about how it\\'s not supposed to be open, come into the room to search, then close the door.\\nOne moment I want to share is when I ran away from a random bandit on the road and a few minutes later he ended up killing the guy I was supposed to turn in a quest to, failing the quest. I will explain with more detail below, there will be spoilers but only for 2 quests:\\n\\n[spoiler] I had just done the quest where you resolve a conflict between two farmers, or farming villages, the one where you put the iron nail to mark a boundary and a lot of NPC\\'s are gathered in one area. One of the NPC\\'s was a guy that wanted me to rescue a sheep called Ignatius.\\nAfter resolving that conflict I went to rescue Ignatius who was not far away. After rescuing Ignatius I opened my map and put a marker where the quest giver was because there were already so many overlapping icons for me at the top compass bar that it\\'s just easier to follow the red flag. I didn\\'t realise the quest giver would keep walking from there.\\nAs I rode my horse towards the marker, a bandit tried to attack me on the road but I kept going. When I got to my marker the guy wasn\\'t there so I opened my map, realised I must have passed him as he was walking towards the sheep herd I lead Ignatius to and so I started riding my horse back the way I came. Soon afterwards I get notified that the quest failed. I kept going and saw the dead body of that quest giver lying on the thin road next to that same bandit, right near where I had also encountered the bandit. I reloaded the auto save from ending the previous quest, rescued Ignatius again but this time the bandit wasn\\'t even there at all. [/spoiler]\\n\\nI didn\\'t even mind having to reload and do the quest again because really that was my fault for not dealing with the bandit and leaving him to attack someone more vulnerable.\\nThe game has enough depth where your playthrough is at least seemingly unique to you and I think that\\'s a crowning achievement, a lot of passion must have been poured into it.\\n\\nThe scripted comedy balances out all the tense dramatic moments of the main quests to create a bodacious experience.

We got cosmetics (also limited-time ones, given for arbitrary reasons) and microtransactions, then matchmaking and some perverse version of achievements with rewards (Jungle Inferno contracts, anyone?) Finally, we settled on rampant cheating. If I could, I would instead write a review on Valve Anti-Cheat, but here we are…\\r\\n\\r\\nBotting on TF2 got so bad that it was impossible to play, which is something that Valve doesn’t care about anymore if there’s profit in there somewhere. It was only after the community rallied together that Valve “fixed” the issue, but, to this day, if you play long enough and pay enough attention, you will run into more “subtle” cheaters every few games, because commercial solutions exist to cater to such audiences (see: LMAOBOX). Valve’s “anti-cheat” can be completely bypassed by existing open-source code snippets, leading us back to the point that TF2 is truly a product of its time, where basic detection techniques were good enough and everything else past that was duct-taped on top. Now, with the game being maintained by a skeleton crew, there is simply no hope of the situation ever improving. There might be further instances of grand ban waves, but, in the end, it's a war of attrition that Valve will lose.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaking a small detour on to other things stemming from the game’s age - if you’ve played Quake about as long as TF2, you’ll be experiencing a familiar aura of “the meta must not be broken” throughout several game modes (“ye intel shalt not be capped” in CTF and “thou shalt not suck” in Mann Up), not to mention getting destroyed by players with thousands upon thousands of hours spent playing, who may or may not be cheating. Despite all that, there are always new players to be found. Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, they try to have fun in whatever way they see fit, but the more grizzled veterans know that having newbies in your team means getting stomped in a match.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why?”, you ask, “doesn’t the matchmaking system use some sort of rating to balance things out?

The game leaks VRAM and this has been an issue for months and months with seemingly no fix in sight.\\n\\nThe game is 100% absolutely littered with microtransactions and cosmetics. It's definitely not your OG unnamed soldier CoD if that's what you're looking for. It also causes some jarring gameplay issues.

The game was great many years ago when there wasn’t all of this bloat and useless mechanics. The developers have made so many updates and DLCs for the game that should have been in the game to start with. Many of these DLCs were just focus trees that were mediocre at best with maybe one or two useless mechanics, and they cost 20$. There are hundreds of mods on the workshop that are free and 100x better than these DLCs that are just focus trees. The game is more tailored to singleplayer with multiplayer basically not even thought of. These DLCs for the most part are not even usable or balanced for multiplayer. The vast majority of my time is playing on mods that are based off of Road to 56 which almost completely rewrite the game because vanilla is so boring and lacks content. The multiplayer community for the most part is very toxic and in the last couple years hackers have run rampant. There is no firewall or defense against them and if a fix or update comes a new version is out the next day. There are some plus sides to the game though. I have learned the world map, countries, city names, and their locations way too well. There is endless replay factor with hundreds of great mods for all different tastes in gameplay. It’s also fun to watch them numbers go up. Green bubble and dopamine go brrrr. When it comes to new players starting it has a decent learning curve. There are guides but it still can be complicated especially for navy. I recommend to play singleplayer for a while and be able to beat the AI in a decent amount of time and learn the metas for everything.

However, despite my love for the game, recent developments have introduced issues that are difficult to overlook.\\n\\nBefore delving into the details, I must mention that this is my first-ever review on Steam. I felt compelled to share my thoughts because, while I have thoroughly enjoyed ETS2 over the years, the frustration caused by certain aspects of the game has reached a point where I believe it’s important to speak up.\\n\\nThe most glaring problem lies in the performance drops observed in newer DLC maps. While the visual upgrades and reworks in these areas are undoubtedly impressive, they come at a significant cost to performance. Even on systems that comfortably handle the base game and older expansions, these regions often result in frustratingly inconsistent frame rates. What makes this particularly exasperating is the fact that these issues did not exist before the reworks. The optimization—or lack thereof—seems to be an afterthought, leaving players with an experience that is at best distracting and at worst unplayable.\\n\\nAdding to the frustration is the artificial intelligence (AI) of the game, which, despite years of development, remains woefully inadequate. The AI-controlled vehicles routinely demonstrate behaviour that ranges from mildly inconvenient to outright absurd. Sudden lane changes without signalling, failure to yield at intersections, and an uncanny ability to brake at the worst possible moment are just a few examples of the nonsensical antics players must contend with. While a degree of unpredictability is realistic in traffic simulations, the AI in ETS2 often feels less like a reflection of reality and more like a caricature of it.\\n\\nAs a devoted player, it is disheartening to see such issues persist in a title that I hold in such high regard. The developers' commitment to expanding the game’s world is commendable, but these efforts must be matched by a focus on optimization and refinement. Without addressing these problems, the experience of exploring ETS2’s beautifully crafted roads will continue to be overshadowed by technical and design shortcomings.\\n\\nEuro Truck Simulator 2 deserves to shine as the definitive trucking simulator, and I truly want to see it thrive. However, until these frustrations are resolved, even the most loyal fans may find their patience wearing thin.\\n\\nFor a game that I have spent so much time enjoying, writing this review was not an easy decision.

From the moment one steps into the Lands Between, it becomes clear that this is a world of staggering depth and beauty, one that beckons players not merely to explore, but to immerse themselves in its very soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the heart of Elden Ring lies a narrative that is both haunting and elusive, painted in the broad strokes of myth yet rich with subtle intricacies. The collaboration between Hidetaka Miyazaki and George R.R. Martin has birthed a world filled with lore that never overpowers, but instead entices curiosity. The story unfolds not through overt exposition, but through atmospheric hints and environmental storytelling, compelling players to unearth secrets on their own. It is a tapestry of broken kingdoms, forgotten deities, and cosmic forces, where each discovery—whether in the form of a cryptic message, an abandoned structure, or a fleeting encounter—feels like a revelation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe artistry in Elden Ring is breathtaking. From the serene grace of the golden trees in the liminal dusk to the oppressive, yawning voids of desolate catacombs, the game paints its landscapes with a brush that is both grand and intimate. Each area, no matter how bleak, feels alive—teeming with possibility, steeped in history, and imbued with a melancholic beauty that mirrors the world’s fall from grace. It is a visual feast, where even the most innocuous detail—the curvature of a shadow, the scattering of fallen petals—carries the weight of meaning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gameplay itself is an evolution of the meticulous design that FromSoftware has become synonymous with, refined and expanded into an open world that feels boundless yet intimately connected. Every encounter, whether against a towering boss or a subtle ambush in a field of flowers, is a testament to the precision of its mechanics. The difficulty, while legendary, is never unfair; it is an invitation to grow, to learn, to rise above adversity through patience, strategy, and resilience. And through it all, there is a profound sense of agency. The world does not hand you your path—it challenges you to carve your own.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps most remarkable of all is the game’s ability to evoke a feeling of quiet reverence. Elden Ring is not a game that rushes; it exists in its own deliberate pace. The slow, rhythmic exploration of its vast expanses—interrupted by fleeting moments of terror, triumph, and wonder—gives rise to a sense of time itself being altered. In a world that often demands constant motion, this game asks players to stop, to look, to feel.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, Elden Ring stands as an unparalleled work of art. It is a testament to the enduring power of the medium, proving that video games are not mere diversions, but can be profound expressions of creativity, vision, and emotion. It is a world to be revered, a journey to be savored, and an experience that will linger long after its final chapter is written. To play it is to witness not just a game, but the unfolding of a masterpiece.', 'timestamp_created': 1740345638, 'timestamp_updated': 1740345638, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 31, 'votes_funny': 4, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.654483616352081299', 'comment_count': 2, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': False, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}\n",

The developers of this game really tried hard to combine the free open world concept with the style of how many “souls like” games function. \\n\\nMy experience with Elden ring was entirely Co-op. I experienced 100+ hours of endless boss slaying and exploration on what seemed like an almost endless journey. I love how one minute you will be walking around a tree and then a few seconds later a boss approaches you. Lots of surprises. I will say- the Co-op mod itself had MANY bugs which are definitely game breaking, however there are ways around them (Definitely not ”seem-less”). \\n\\nIn terms of style, the game is original and jaw dropping beautiful. The lands itself show the misery of the tarnished and the destruction caused by attempts of many to claim the Elden Lord throne. The mix of supernatural, magic, nature and royalty is such a beautiful mix to encounter…. Oh and the music of the game fits the vibe PERFECTLY. \\n\\nAside from the main story bosses, there are no rules for which bosses to face and when. Although this doesn’t sound optimal, I actually found that the game progresses you at a great pace and allows you the ability to achieve anything as long as you keep it balanced. Take a break from story bosses and explore the lands, finish a side quest line or explore clues to solve puzzles.\\n\\nI was honestly a bit disappointed with the mechanics of the game. I chose intelligence as my build and found SEVERAL limitations. These weapons were lack luster and you should definitely steer away from this class for this kind of game. Also, most of the main story bosses provide you with STR/DEX weapons. You could argue that the game leads you into trying different builds, but then why would they make you choose a class when you first start? This decision can punish you late game if you don’t grind for the extra levels you basically wasted. Aside from classes, movement is a nightmare. Most of my deaths were from falling off things and I don’t believe it was my fault even half the time. I will say, the main combat mechanics were very enjoyable once I switched builds late game. Likewise, Boss fights are very interesting and it takes time to learn the moves and get good- I love that about this game. It’s definitely the challenge that everyone is looking for.\\n\\nThe main story was pretty decent, although somewhat confusing if you are trying to connect it all together. I know the game was not intended to shove a bunch of story down your throat so honestly I’m not too upset. Definitely not my preferred story telling method though.\\n\\nOverall, this game was a great experience and I do recommend playing if you are looking for something challenging and enjoy the thrill of seeking new bosses to takedown.', 'timestamp_created': 1740240876, 'timestamp_updated': 1740240876, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 1, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.523809552192687988', 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': False, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}\n",

Your Sim will still perform unwanted actions in conversation, such as mischief actions or singing, even if your Sim is Good, or a Bro. I just feel that, your sim shouldn't randomly choose to do actions that don't even align with their traits to begin with, even if Autonomy is enabled.

What once brought joy to me (for 200 hours) became a pay-to-play game to the EXTREME. It costs approximately 1.2 THOUSAND dollars of DLC to have the \"full experience\". but just wait! their 60 dollar packs add about 10 dollars worth of actual content, and shit aesthetics. It\\'s EA, of COURSE they would do this. All of those 1.2k dollars, would go to DLC packs that conflict directly, break game saves, override other DLC game files, and overall, are kinda shit. Who needs a clothing pack specifically for south korean fashion, and then mix it with the game pack based on Japan? and there are no good black hairstyles. I don\\'t want my sims of color to have weird globe hairstyles. You know, the fans make better content anyways, and yet with each update the sims 4 mods become unusable due to programming conflicting. I do not like how much processing or GPU power this takes considering the graphics themselves look like a mobile game. Cant even render the in game profiles to match the CAS system sims. I spent HOURS formulating my genderqueer sim just to lose the save file because the male sim gender having an actual baby for some reason makes the game die when I specifically said the sim COULD give birth. I do not understand the appeal of spending even 60 dollars for a game pack (the sims4 pets) to be added when that should have been a basic feature at release.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can you call this a life sim, when the sims do not experience things such as negative moodlets.

It is a life sim but I want to be mentally engaged as well. \\r\\n\\r\\nHow come this game is marketed as free when in reality if you want a complete game, you need to buy 120 dollars of DLC (in my opinion) for it to even compete with a free indie game on Itch.io or Indie gogo. This is a disappointment of a game, but again, EA is a disappointment as a whole.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeaking of EA, and don\\'t get me started), the third party EA launcher, or whatever, it used to be Origin like 2 years ago, but then they MOVED it, to whatever random thing it is now, and I noticed a friend of mine paid for all the DLC at the time and could not access it due to Origin accounts not lining up. I think it is a load of bull that you require a third party launcher. What is Steam, then? Is steam not a viable option with actual CLOUD SAVES so that I may access my 2 remaining good save files when moving pcs? Or is that too difficult for you? \\r\\n\\r\\nI understand the desire for proprietary software to manage users games, however, it is VERY anti-consumer when compared to the asking price of the Sims 4 DLCs, considering the useful ones are 60 dollars, and RARELY go on sale, if ever. \\r\\n\\r\\nI saved up so much of my childhood allowance foe my first sims 4 pack, just for it to ruin my game save.

I\\'ve put so many hours in those games, I don\\'t even want to know how many exactly, but I enjoyed the majority of them. Of course I was excited when Sims 4 was announced but... now it\\'s 2025 and I still can\\'t warm up to it.\\nWe had a rough start to begin with, because I was very unhappy when the information got dropped that things like toddlers, pools, etc. weren\\'t part of the game anymore. When those things got reintroduced I gave it a chance eventually.\\n\\nI\\'ve started it so many times by now, but I always lose interest so fast. I really wanted to love it, but it just couldn\\'t catch me. Not knowing why for a long time I think I am starting to figure it out. So here is why I don\\'t like the Sims 4 personally.\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Game Design / Lack of details\\nDespite the bumpy start and it\\'s recovering I\\'ve got dissapointed really fast again by the game design choices. I thought it would go further into realism and not a huge step back. Ironically I would say SIms 1 was the most realistic for its time. All the details at the stores, the furniture, the trees, it looked amazing and still does. You could literally see the love which was put into the game. Sims 2 maybe took a tiny step back in its realism but we all saw how much love and work was put into this game with all the little details and interactions. Sims 3 took another step back related to the enviorment but a huge step forward in character design. I know the game get\\'s bigger and you need to make a few compromises. But Sims 4 came and got rid of all of it for no reason.\\n\\n[*] Difficulty\\nEvery Sims 1 player knows how difficult the game could be, even with one Sim at a time. It often brought me to the point of despair and yeah, it could have been a little more balanced, but it was a challenge we could master. I would say Sims 2 balanced it pretty well. Today I gave Sims 4 another try and started all over, created a sim, moved her in and then... nothing. She was always happy, I had enough money at the start to have no problems at all, no challenges, I had 4 friends visiting me regularly in the first 45 minutes, I\\'ve got pomotion after promotion. I had literally nothing to do, nothing to work for. I know most players enjoy the building process the most but I was always more of a \"player\". You know those people exist EA, do you?\\n\\n[*]Customability (in design)\\nSims 3 had so much stuff you could customise (the hair color, the clothes, furniture,...), it made it very individual and fun to work with. Why got Sims 4 got so extremely limited? Why did it took back another huge step in that direction? I hoped for even more custimability in the next game in line, not less.\\n\\n[*] Randomness\\nI also miss the randomness Sims 1 and 2 shined with, it may was weird, but entertaining for sure. I\\'ve played 122h so far and I can\\'t recall an entertaining/interesting event, something memorable that happened out of the blue. (For example the crazy phone calls or the Clown in Sims 1 or the aliens in Sims 2). I know burglars still exist, but I never seen one so far.\\n[/list]\\n\\nBut there are some things I appreciate about this game and I want to mention them:\\nI like the new way approaching emotions, the multitasking features and all the different skills your Sim can learn. But is it worth to spend as much money on as with the other games? \\nIf you prefer building - yes (event tho I would still stick to Sims 3 personally). If you prefer roleplaying, attention to detail and challenges - no.\\n\\nIt just feels like a big cash grab for me.

Dead by Daylight is likely one of the worst multiplayer games to try to pick up and play in modern gaming due to the sheer amount of complexity that is involved in learning this game. I have accumulated 1600+ hours over around a year and a half, and I can confidently say that I have a firm grasp of this game and its various mechanics, perks, killers, and techs. There is some fun to be had in this game for sure, but some fun is all you will get as it will quickly sour and turn into one of the most frustrating games you will ever play. Both sides of this asymmetrical game are extremely infuriating due to how terrible the DBD community has become and due to how incompetent Behaviour Interactive is at maintaining their biggest game with no competition.\\n\\n[h2]How it feels to play killer [/h2]\\nWhile playing killer, you will feel powerless and survivors will often have perks builds that intentionally torture you the entire match. A group of survivors queued together is a very common reason your matches as killer will be so insufferable due to the match becoming almost impossible to win if the survivors are good enough. Personally, I do enjoy going against high skill survivors and trying my best to outsmart them and use my own personal skill to win the match, but more than likely you will not win against these kinds of players. This makes playing killer feel almost hopeless at times because you just can’t catch a single break as you lose match after match. Trying to play fair will often result in you losing so you will almost be forced into using meta perks and “toxic” gameplay to enjoy any of your matches. As a killer player, you will have to be aware of the “Survivor Rulebook” where you prioritize their fun over your own. If you want to win the match as a killer it’s “toxic” or try-harding but when survivors want to win it’s fair for them to use every means necessary. It’s a very hard balance to maintain as you want to enjoy your match but also want to make the match fun for the survivors as I think it’s important to remember that the survivors are people who are playing the game just the same as you are. Killer gameplay can be very rewarding and satisfying at times, yet it ends up getting more and more stressful as you get less and less gameplay when you prioritize fun over winning because generators will get finished very quickly without constant babysitting.\\n\\n[h2]How it feels to play survivor [/h2]\\nWhile playing survivor, you will come across many toxic killers that make the game absolute hell for your team. This can be fixed by queuing with friends and working together to skew the match heavily in your favor as this game becomes extremely survivor sided once there is direct communication between the survivors. There are also many perks that can drastically improve your chances at winning as a survivor. Some of these perks have been practically unchanged from their initial release such as Dead Hard being a meta perk since it was released back in 2017 and maintaining its place as one of the best perks in the game till the modern day. This makes survivor gameplay pretty stale because you have to use perks that give you as much advantage to try and survive against killers using meta perks as well. Playing survivor can end up feeling quite good after a while, but your general experience will end up being unpleasant due to the large amount of killers and perks you have to learn to play around.\\n\\n\\n[h2]Items, Add-ons, Map Offerings [/h2]\\nBoth sides fall into this meta hell of using the best things the game allows you to use so that your matches feel less frustrating and left up to chance. Adding any sort of variety to the perks you pick increases the risk of you having no fun in your matches significantly. There are also plenty of items for survivors and killer add-ons to use as well to increase your chances of winning. These can feel necessary sometimes because of how good survivor items can be and how bad your killer's basekit can be without certain add-ons. There are also map offerings which will end up being used in many of your matches because certain maps in this game give an extreme advantage to one side or the other according to their perks or their killer. This is one of the worst parts of the game because you essentially lose the match before it even starts. They are addressing this issue, but it’s much too late.\\n\\n[h2]Personal Experience/Rant [/h2]\\nMy personal experience with this game has been easily negative as it has been one of the most unfun, stressful, and anxiety filling games I have ever played. Despite my utter [b]hate[/b] for this game, I kept playing it somehow. There’s something severely addicting about this game where it feels like you spin a slot machine to try and have fun in each match. I typically prefer playing killer because survivor solo queue is extremely unfun/inconsistent (also cause Wesker is very fun), yet I have around equal time playing killer and survivor. Even when I win a match as a killer, it feels like I haven’t won because of how unfun and stressful the typical match can end up being or it was so easy to win that it feels unsatisfying. I typically don’t even expect to win my survivor matches because I feel like when you pick survivor you shouldn’t expect to survive. The entire lore of DBD is that the survivors are supposed to be under-powered and tortured by the entity, but they end up being the ones dictating the flow of the match the higher elo you get. It feels as if the main goal of this game has become solely to win rather than enjoy the match on your own terms and that is obvious the more you play against better players. Many DBD players are chronically online and end up being some of the worst people you can interact with as they cannot take a single bit of criticism or negativity without it becoming a personal attack on them. There’s certainly some good cookies out there, but if you play this game enough you will end up playing against or with these entitled DBD addicts. They take the game much too seriously and ruin the experience for others. There’s also the competitive scene of this game which I think is a joke (no offense to the people who partake in it). DBD has to be one of the most competitively unviable games I have ever played and the majority of the games I have the most time in have been competitive games. It’s extremely unbalanced and even when played at the highest level it has to have so many rules to make it viable as a competitive game. There is also the issue of Behaviour Interactive being some of the worst developers for an extremely popular game that is constantly getting bigger and bigger media licenses for their game that they seemingly cannot fix. It feels as if there is another game breaking issue every other update or even more frequently than that. I’m not gonna sit here and pretend game development is easy, but I’m not going to let Behaviour try to convince people that the bugs and glitches they allow in the game aren’t a problem. They’ve also removed certain features of killers that had increased the skill ceiling of those killers such as Blight Hugtech being removed. This gives the implication of other skillful mechanics that weren’t intended being removed like Wesker Hugtech or Hillbilly/Oni 180 Flicks which slowly makes the game even less fun for skillful play. Wesker Hugtechs and his general gameplay have been the main reason I stuck around this game. I’m around my limit of playing this game consistently because it just isn’t fun anymore. I have no incentive to continue improving past the point I have reached because the game just isn’t worth it. \\n\\n[h1]I regret playing this game.

The game had potential, but it's been bogged down by poor balancing, a toxic community, and constant technical issues.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Horrible Balance Issues\\r\\nThe game is notorious for either favoring killers or survivors, depending on the latest patch. Survivors have overwhelming second-chance perks, making it nearly impossible to secure kills, while killers can sometimes be overpowered, leaving survivors with no real chance of escape. Instead of true balance, the game just swings wildly between patches, frustrating both sides.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Terrible Matchmaking & Ranking System\\r\\nThe matchmaking is a complete joke. New players often get matched against experienced killers or teams of survivors running meta perks, making the game incredibly unfun. On top of that, the ranking system doesn't reward actual skill—it's all about grinding.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Bugs, Bugs, and More Bugs\\r\\nFor a game that's been out since 2016, Dead by Daylight still feels like an early-access title. Hitboxes are wildly inconsistent, killers swing through objects, and survivors teleport due to lag. Dedicated servers are unreliable, and random disconnections happen way too often.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. The Grind is Exhausting\\r\\nUnlocking perks, characters, and cosmetics is painfully slow unless you’re willing to shell out money. The progression system is designed to make players frustrated enough to spend on DLC and in-game currency. It’s more of a cash grab than a rewarding experience.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Toxic Community & Unfair Mechanics\\r\\nThe community is one of the worst in online gaming. Both survivors and killers constantly BM (bad-manner), teabag, or spam emotes. It feels like a never-ending loop of toxic behavior, whether you're winning or losing. If you’re a killer, expect to get flashlight spammed and mocked at the exit gate. If you're a survivor, expect face-camping and tunneling.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinal Verdict\\r\\nDead by Daylight is a frustrating, unbalanced mess that relies too much on its existing fanbase rather than fixing core gameplay issues. If you enjoy being annoyed by unfair matchmaking, game-breaking bugs, and a toxic community, then by all means, give it a try. Otherwise, save yourself the headache and play something else.\\r\\n\\r\\n⭐ 2/5 - Disappointing and Frustrating\", 'timestamp_created': 1740172765, 'timestamp_updated': 1740172765, 'voted_up': False, 'votes_up': 40, 'votes_funny': 1, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.690900921821594238', 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': False, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}\n",

The map is huge, full of secrets and treasures. There are over 200 species of animals combined. The weapon variety is also impressive. There are many mini-games to choose from. Every character in the camp is complex enough to make you care and sympathize with them. Some side missions can feel like the main storyline at several points. The world scenery and game mechanics are just incredible. All of this is amazing and already over the top for a game, but the primary protagonist you control takes the cake.\\n\\nArthur Morgan is one of the best-written characters in all RPGs. He is a deeply flawed man who made some pretty rough decisions in his life. Since he is a teen, who takes an example from his outlaw father, to the time when he is found by the gang, he goes against the newly emerging societal norms in the Wild West. But most of all, he always believes in Dutch and the gang. He does everything for them - he lives, he murders, he robs. And when this is put to the ultimate test, against the clock, his true redemption begins. You will find that behind this immaculately strong personality, there is a scared man. Of what he is, of what he will become. After this point, you will begin to realize what I'm talking about and why Arthur is so loved by the entire community. He is not perfect, no one is. But he tries his best.\\n\\nTake your time to experience this game.

I picked this up and was very excited to play it, but when attempting to open it I received a message that my steam account was already linked to a rockstar account that is linked to an old email address of mine and that i needed to get a code they were emailing me in order to open the game - apparently, because I purchased a Rockstar game 13 years ago and made an Rockstar account then my steam account was already linked to a pre-existing Rockstar account with an old email address. And unfortunately this old email address was hacked and shut down and I can't access it. This seems like it should be an easy fix right? Steam should just be able to unlink this old Rockstar account, right? WRONG - steam says they can't (or more accurately) wont unlink your old Rockstar account and that you, the customer, have to deal with Rockstar games and beg them to de-link the old rockstar account from steam. Okay, so, still, this shouldnt be so hard to fix, right? Since you have your steam ID, the name of the old email address, proof of purchase, and screenshots of everything + gobs of other proof that you are who you say you are and just want to play a game that you legally purchased, you should be able to submit a request to Rockstar games and in a reasonable amount of time they should be able to just hit a few buttons on a keyboard fix your steam account running, right? WRONG - after submitting countless requests and emails and complaints and photos they say they've investigated and there's no evidence that you own your steam account. \\n\\nFrankly this is lazy, shit customer service. On top of that, there is literrally no reason to ever have a Rockstar Game account, no one would ever open one if it wasn't forced on you by this company. Rockstar has some great games, but theres no point if you cant even open them on steam.

And if you are used to this the mechs of the dungeons even the solo dungeons are quite easy (to easy in my opinion). I hate the fact that alot of player do not want to learn hard mechs anymore and that the devs need to simplify mechs only so that the community can easely clear the content only because the majority is not willing to learn harder mechs (They found a good midleground in my opinion to be fair). Like the Daigon Guild Raid we did it with 18 Persons with only T1 gear. Thats hard but having everybody under 50% hp until Daigon starts it second phase at 50% hp makes it possible to clear the raid before he enrages and one hits everybody because of the time cap. Thats only giving healers pthd because the have to leave everybody at half ho xd. But people will without reading through the debuff list where this effect is stated already complain its to hard and as mentioned we where all tier 1 gear for a tier 2 boss that should be extremly hard and only with 18 out of possibly 70 players its doable.

Combat feels now good, plenty of PvP and alot of stuff to do. The game itself is pretty much free for PvE players but PvP players need to grind alot of use $$$.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut i am reviewing this game on RETURNING PLAYERS perspective. If the idea was to get ppl back, it failed really badly and here is why:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Returning player rewards were pretty damn bad. It is basicly extra \"14 days log in rewards\" that included some usefull stuff. But alot of the really usefull stuff did not come in day 1-3\\r\\n- No real catchup package. So if you stopped playing before they introduced runes etc, you did not get any \"catch up\" rune package. You did not get enough growth stones to even keep your current GS and that basicly meant no new content.\\r\\n- 2600 solo dungeon is so hard that if you play tank, prepare to play hours and hours. I played SNS/GS and it was almost impossible and if you are good it still takes ages.\\r\\n- They have not fixed gear transfer problem. So ppl like me who had their starting gear from release and transfered later on to blue set pieces, you are fked because you cant transfer them. Same goes for accessories. And because of this dont get enough growth stones, your t2 gear will be level 4 at best.\\r\\n- New mastery system was overall improvement and more interesting, Problem i had was that even i have +40 points to spend, i cant because i dont have enough gems to unlock them. So you basicly lost all the mastery tree and got new one that you cant use. On top of that if you want to reroll weapon with the free coupon, You dont have mastery because it costs gems you dont want to lose.\\r\\n- Free weapon mastery change coupon is last reward from DLC pass. So if you were interested to reroll, too bad, you need to suffer until you get DLC pass to level 25.\\r\\n- Lucient situation is horrible for new on returning players\\r\\n\\r\\nSo how to fix all of this?\\r\\n1. Change the gear transfer system so you can transfer ONCE inside the rarity tier and as many times from rarity to rarity. So you can go: (early ( t1 blue) -> t2 blue -> t2 epic to -> endgame epic ). And because of we did not even have all the gear in DLC release, this would be mandatory to get ppl back.\\r\\n2. Give new and returning players DAY 1 CATCHUP pack. Basic runes, good amount of growth stones and weapon mastery REROLL COUPON. maybe some skill change scrolls.\\r\\n3. Nerf the lowest level solo dungeon. ATM it is really really really hard for tanks. \\r\\n4. Help new and returning players to obtain some lucient. I dont know how, but you would figure it out.\\r\\n5. Remove gem costs for early weapon mastery tree. I think that second point you use should not cost anything, later on it is fine. Or you should kept the old tree for few weeks so returning players could get enough gems to change to new weapon mastery.\\r\\n\\r\\nOtherwise pretty solid DLC.\\r\\n', 'timestamp_created': 1741355766, 'timestamp_updated': 1741355766, 'voted_up': False, 'votes_up': 0, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': 0.5, 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': False, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}\n",

Let me break it down myself.\\n\\n[h1] Gameplay and Content [/h1] \\n\\nThe game offers a large selection of things to do at any given moment in time. Sure, there is a lot of grinding, but what MMO doesn\\'t have grinding? I have comments enabled, name one. So, one negative review I saw said that the entire game is doing an event in 5 minutes, waiting 15 minutes afk, fighting a boss, then waiting again. S/he likened it to a second job. First of all, there\\'s events almost every hour on the hour. Second, what event takes 5 minutes? I don\\'t know of any that do, and the bosses usually run from on the hour until at least 15 minutes after, if not 20 or 30 depending on the boss and the participation. Even if you are between events, there is plenty to do, and yes most of it is grinding. With the newest major update, the amount of stuff you can do has just expanded. You can raid dungeons (use abyssal tokens to gain currency and weapon xp), do the co-op instanced matchmaking dungeons (similar to FFXIV) and get gear, if you haven\\'t already by the time you hit level 50 do Taedal\\'s Tower which is a solo experience that gives you rewards (one time only though). There\\'s weekly challenges, weekly solo dungeons, weekly versions of taedal tower bosses, there\\'s now war games, there\\'s the new island that has PvP and PvE and gives end-game rewards, there\\'s field and archbosses multiple times a day now with all of the new ones added, there is literally anything else to do. If someone complains that there is \"nothing to do\" between events, or that they are \"just waiting afk\", that is a self inflicted wound and it\\'s on them. They just don\\'t WANT to do all of the other things available to them.\\n\\n[h1] Gear and Mechanics [/h1]\\n\\nAnother part of the game that I personally find well done but a lot of people have issues with is the mechanics and the gear system. There\\'s also the skills. I\\'ll start with the mechanics.\\n\\nThe mechanics of the game are pretty typical of what you would expect from an MMO. Stacking buffs/debuffs, damage/healing/effects that proc off of that stackable de/buff, other effects that could possibly proc off of that additional status. The nitty gritty comes down to certain character stats which I myself am still learning. There\\'s critical chance and heavy attack chance. Critical chance is just how often you would get additional damage on an attack, heavy attack chance is how often a skill you use activates twice on each use. For example, a high heavy attack chance can mean that you cast fire bomb and it activates twice, dealing double damage. Some effects proc more off of critical like \"applies 1 stack of status effect, but applies additional stack of status effect for every critical hit\". \\nYou also have defense, endurance, and evasion. Defense and endurance are decently straightforward. Having a high evasion in melee/ranged/magic means that you are more likely to completely dodge that type of attack and not take damage or status effects at all. \\nI think that the numbers system of the game is done decently well on that front and that\\'s for the mechanics. \\n\\nAs for the gear system, this is where most of the grinding comes into play. You will want to have an idea of what your ideal gear setup is and work towards it. Half of the battle is acquiring your ideal gear pieces (actually maybe less than that), the other part of the battle is not only levelling up your gear, but traiting it too. Leveling it up unlocks it\\'s full potential (a staff at level 1 gives 1 wisdom and 1 perception, but at max level might give 5 wisdom and 4 perception). Traiting it unlocks additional traits (Max Health 600, Heavy Attack Chance 80, Hit Chance 60 etc). You will want to pick gear that has complimenting gear set bonuses. There are 5 gear slots that count towards gear set bonuses (Head, Chest, Pants, Hands, Feet) and gear sets that have bonuses have them applied at 2 pieces and 4 pieces (2 pieces of X gear gives Y effect, 4 pieces of X gear gives Y and Z effect). You might be better served combining the set bonuses of 2 different gear sets, or going all in on one set. Certain weapons change entire mechanics. Abyssal Renaissance Foci changes frost spear into a lightning spear, Lequirus\\'s Tome makes you invisible for a certain period of time on reaching low health, Queen Bellandir\\'s staff adds a chance for insane damage with fire attacks. The gear is just one aspect of the depth of the game. \\n\\nNow for skills. You have your basic skills such as serial fire bombs, chain lightning, swift healing, etc. Then you have skill specialization which changes aspects of that skill. For example, serial fire bombs, which fires 3 fire projectiles that add 1 stack of burning each or 2 for criticals, can become a focused fire bomb that fires one large projectile on a cast timer, or you can make it where you remove the cast timer for serial fire bombs and allow movement while casting, or you can do all together and have a focused fire bomb that charges on a cast timer, allows movement while charging and even add in a 200% projectile speed increase specialization. You can make swift healing cast 3 times instead of 2 before going on CD, increase range by 5 meters and make it restore 40% of healing done as mana to the recipient. \\n\\nAside from skill specialization, there is weapon mastery, which can further expand on the skills. \\n\\nThere\\'s really a lot to this game and it\\'s up to you to make your own impression of the game. It has beautiful and gorgeous graphics, a lot of cosmetics and a free and paid version of each battle pass and leveling pass. Do not go into the game with the expectation that you will dislike it because of reviews, nor with the expectation you will like it because of reviews. Form your own opinion, don\\'t follow a shepherd, and enjoy what you enjoy. \\n\\nI recommend the game as an MMO.

I still remember firing up my PlayStation 4 on launch day, my excitement when joining many other players as newly awakened Guardians. After starting out in the Cosmodrome on Earth, I’d travel all over the solar system to fight for the fate of humanity in PvE encounters – or against fellow guardians in PvP matches (thank you, Hawkmoon). Since I was also playing through each of the four expansions when they released, I soon racked up way over 500h of playtime - and while the original [i]Destiny[/i] definitely wasn’t a perfect experience in many ways, it gave me a lot of fond memories that I cherish to this day.\\n\\nIn 2017, [i]Destiny 2[/i] was released, although in a very different form compared to what the game is like today. First off, while the games only featured time-limited content in the form of special events before, tied to occurrences like Valentine’s Day or Halloween for example, the release of the [i]Forsaken[/i] expansion in 2018 saw [i]Destiny 2[/i] introducing a seasonal model to the game: New additions to the game in terms of story and gameplay, that were releasing between the annual paid expansions, where now tied to “seasons” - with most of this new content apart from your claimed rewards being removed once a season ends. While other MMOs, like [i]Final Fantasy XIV[/i], keep their story (patch) content available forever, [i]Destiny 2[/i] was now requiring players to keep playing if they don’t want to miss out on how the still ongoing plot, that started with the original [i]Destiny[/i], develops. It was at this point that I stopped playing [i]Destiny 2[/i] frequently and only returned for a bit every time a new expansion released, as I didn’t want to be stuck to a game that puts an expiry date on its story content.\\n\\nUnfortunately, in retrospective, this would only turn out to be the beginning of the horrid relationship that [i]Destiny 2[/i] has with its older content. After going free-to-play with the release of the [i]Shadowkeep[/i] expansion in 2019, which didn’t mean much as you still had to pay for past and future expansions, the year 2020 and the [i]Beyond Light[/i] expansion brought what many players consider to be most problematic change in the history of the entire game:  The “vaulting” of [i]Destiny 2[/i] content.\\n\\nTo cut it short, over time [i]Destiny 2[/i] removed earlier campaign content from the game, which includes the original “Red War” campaign as well as those from the [i]Curse of Osiris[/i], [i]Warmind[/i] and [i]Forsaken[/i] expansion. Notably, this does not only include the campaign missions but entire locations like Mars, Mercury, Titan, etc. as well. They’re simply gone, with no way to currently experiencing them again apart from watching old playthroughs on YouTube. While they could [i]potentially[/i] return one day, it hasn’t happened for the campaigns at this point, and I think it’s fair to say they never will. While the entirety of the original [i]Destiny[/i] remains online and playable, there is no an incredibly large gap between the last events of the game and the currently playable events in [i]Destiny 2[/i] – not only in terms of the already time-limited seasonal content.\\n\\nWhile the intro experience has been redesigned according with the “vaulting” of campaigns, frankly, even as a veteran like I am it’s a miserable experience trying to keep up the story, with so much content vital to the overall narrative removed. Sure, you could resort to dozens of YouTube videos to figure out the missing links, but this is something that a (new) player shouldn’t have to do – while [i]Destiny 2[/i] does offer a dedicated recap page with very brief descriptions in order to keep you in the loop, it obviously can’t replace the experience of playing through the content by yourself. As such, while the latest [i]The Final Shape[/i] expansion might’ve concluded ten years of storytelling to a certain degree, it still feels like the last pages of a book that had entire chapters ripped out from, with the missing information only being available through second-hand reports from other readers.\\n\\nThat said, [i]Destiny 2[/i] sure likes to take money for the older content is hasn’t yet vaulted. While diving into details here would unfortunately take too long, I just want to point out that the “Legacy Collection” and even the biggest “Light & Darkness Collection” bundle doesn’t somehow include full access to all available content in [i]Destiny 2[/i] – as they’re missing the dungeons from the [i]Witch Queen[/i] & [i]Lightfall[/i] expansions. It also feels incredibly ironic to still sell the [i]Forsaken[/i] expansion at a price of 19,99€, since much of the content in the expansion got vaulted, including the campaign – which means it’s just access to a few weapons, a dungeon and a raid now. Did I mention that seasons also offer a premium battle-pass for sale, including buyable tier skips?\\n\\nWhile I haven’t yet talked about the absolute disaster that is the [i]Destiny 2[/i] PvP experience, which is incredibly punishing for new players, or the amount of pop-ups, intro-missions and cutscenes you receive when starting up the game for the first few times, by now it should be clear that [i]Destiny 2[/i] is almost outstandingly bad at introducing new players to the game – or at reintroducing players who have been absent for a longer time. This is especially infuriating because below all these aggressively unfriendly design decisions, there is an incredible game hiding.\\n\\nI absolutely love the gunplay of the franchise for example, fighting against the various enemy factions is usually extremely satisfying. Some of the highest-rarity guns (“exotics”) have become my favourites across all the first-person shooters I have played, be it through their unique effects or great look. In general, the art direction and soundtrack of the franchise is incredible, which makes the ”vaulting” of old locations even more painful, as some beautiful sights are now lost to time. Finally, tackling even the toughest challenges with a group of friends can make for extremely memorable experiences – I still vividly remember the excitement after finishing my first raid, for example.\\n\\nStill, despite all the greatness that [i]Destiny 2[/i] can offer – which it once again proved with its latest expansion - it’s unfortunately the type of MMO that’s best-described as a “you had to be there”-experience, since it’s painfully bad at allowing new players to catch-up with the long-playing veterans. While not impossible, getting into [i]Destiny 2[/i] requires a certain amount of work that’s understandably deterring to a lot of players – if I were to start out with the game as it is now, I probably would’ve quit the franchise after a few hours or so. Even while [i]Destiny[/i] remains a good starting point if you got a PlayStation/Xbox available, the narrative gap that follows now is likely going to be too large for most players. Hopefully, the franchise can get a fresh start one day, with a [i]Destiny 3[/i] that is once again welcome to all kinds of players, old and new.', 'timestamp_created': 1739636614, 'timestamp_updated': 1739637371, 'voted_up': False, 'votes_up': 131, 'votes_funny': 2, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.810749471187591553', 'comment_count': 7, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': False, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}\n",

I may not agree with everything Bungie the company does to make money, but what I can say is the reason you fell in love with Destiny to begin with is here and better than ever. Every single system has improved, from Trials to Vanguard Strikes, Bounties have been somewhat reworked into Pathfinder, which is genuinely rewarding and not just a bunch of chores. It seems to be an infinite source of power from what I can tell, as you can reset your Pathfinder multiple times a week. How you build your character feels like a real RPG. Obviously there is a meta, but with all the investment they've made into subclasses, you have a vast array of options to express yourself as a Guardian in Sol. The Prismatic class is one of the coolest designed work Bungie has done - it's almost hard to believe Bungie was willing to concede that much freedom to the player.\\n\\nOverall, is Destiny 2 perfect?

I love the game and I always will. I will still play the game until it gets shutdown or until there\\'s no more content, but I can\\'t recommend this game to anyone, especially to new players and for returning players to spend their time elsewhere. There\\'s a plethora of issues, issues that I initially thought about putting in this review, but only to decide that the poor decisions Bungie made aren\\'t going to be fixed or reconciled with so what\\'s the point in reiterating them. If you\\'re curious, I can only suggest you do your own research on Bungie\\'s poor decisions such as layoffs and deleting DLCs, how the story is now a jumbled mess that you wont understand unless you\\'ve been here from the start, how the experience for new and returning players is a horrid slog, how the gameplay loop is now a boring farm, how content contributes to FOMO, and how the game is a husk of what it once was (just to name a few).\\n\\nAnyone new seeking a fun game, don\\'t bother with Destiny 2 as the new player experience is a boring slog of information that you\\'ll never understand unless you\\'ve been here for all of it before. A gameplay loop of struggling to climb a ladder only to be met with a community rarely accepting those who don\\'t know how to play the game. There\\'s so few new players that you won\\'t be able to play a lot of the endgame content for 2 reasons. The first being that rarely do old players wanna play with someone who\\'s new to a lot of the content, especially older content, so older players will either kick you or ignore you. The second being that all the older players aren\\'t playing old content to begin with, but instead the newer content, so you\\'ll have a tough time finding players for old stuff. Older content really benefits from new players, but because the new player experience is so poor, you\\'ll be left out of a lot of the game if you somehow stick around.\\n\\nFor anyone returning, seek another game as the returning experience will have you feeling empty at the lack of content available or understanding for what\\'s happening now. Miss a couple seasons and now you\\'re wondering \"why are we friends with the Cabal/Fallen?\". The only people who benefit from the game in its current state are those who have been here from the start, have been on every day/week, have played all the content, who have stayed up to date on everything. Many of the issues new players face, returning players will face too. Destiny 2 is not what it once was so if you\\'re returning, wanting to experience nostalgia, you\\'re bound for a poor time.\\n\\nI will say, however, despite the numerous flaws the game has, it can be fun with friends, but only for a limited amount of time. If you wanna just shoot stuff and farm for gear, it isn\\'t the worse, but better options still exist. Bungie has made a ton of poor decisions that have ultimately made Destiny 2 a dying cash cow for them as it\\'s their only successful product that will inevitably shutdown. It just won\\'t last as long as many of us would hope for and it\\'s nothing like what it was when it first released.

But it shows how good the game is when all of this doesn\\'t really matter or affect my view on it.\\n\\nThe gameplay is incredible. Truly amazing stuff. There is a triple combo that really allows for unique playstyles. \\n1- cyberware\\n2- class-type skill trees\\n3- weapon type skills\\n \\nOn my first run I was a borged-out nomad netrunner-tank of a man, wielding nothing but a charge-shotgun with two barrels and a heart of hatred. The gameplay was on the highest difficulty but I still felt like Robocop. Blasting the shit outta gonks close range and blowing the brain-chips up of fools across the map with my quickhacks.\\n\\nOn my second run I was a double-jumping, quick-dashing mantis-blade streetkid woman that specialised in throwing knives, sniper rifles, pistols, and chopping fools up with my mantis blades. I had no ability to hack, and relied on a berserk booster for melee. This was an entirely different style of gameplay and is truly incredible the devs have built a system where it works and flows as naturally as it does. If I do a third run I\\'ll play as a smart-gun, rifle-focused corpo. \\n\\nThe open world is amazing, absolutely beautiful and with tonnes of detail. It truly defends its right to be open world with the NCPD scanner and gigs/jobs. It\\'s a shame it doesn\\'t have as much interactable establishments in any meaningful way (like eg. the Yakuza games) but still far better than 90% of open world games out there. I\\'d say as far as the map goes it is actually the best I have ever played. No Far Cry, Days Gone, Mad Max, Yakuza, GTA, Sleeping Dogs or whatever really gets close. This is something special.\\n\\nThe story is great, it\\'s a decent foundation that is launched to its peak by the performances of its (voice)actors. This also applies to phantom liberty. The characters are well written and it punches where it needs to. It doesn\\'t forget the PUNK of cyberpunk; even if the \"morals\" the story sort-of forces in your face are a bit dubious at best.\\n\\nOverall, this game is definitely worth picking up. Especially considering you can get it at 50% off quite frequently. Make sure to get the one with Phantom Liberty as imho that expansion has an ending that is absolute cinema. \\n\\nSo yes, TLDR:\\nGOATed story\\nGOATed open world design\\nGOATed side content\\nGOATed gameplay\\nGOATed soundtrack\\nMID character customisation (cmon man this is cyberpunk world, why do I gotta be normal skinny man/skinny woman?)\\nMID in some specific gameplay details (eg. stealth is still fun, but could be better)\\nSOUL CRUSHING axed content. Bruh, monowire hacking, mantis blade wall running, a moonbase etc. would be so cool\\n\\nDefinitely made the right choice if you waited a few years to buy it after the nightmare launch.

This continued until around level 70 when I finished the last of the campaign and started the mapping grind. Once I started the endgame grind I figured this would be when I started being able to really min/max my character, experiment with builds and really dial things in gear-wise. Sadly this was not the case, instead I started to discover just how many little (and sometimes not so little) time sinks have been designed into the game. Everything, inventory management, UI/UX design, buying/selling items, building up enough currency to buy items, finding citadels on the map, literally every aspect of the game’s design is engineered to hold your time hostage and then for some of it they offer to ransom it back to you for real money. Some will argue that you can play the game without spending a penny and they would be right, you can. However the game is specifically designed to make that choice hamper your gameplay in every respect. \\n\\nBeyond the design elements that attempt to ransom your time back to you there are elements that just unapologetically thumb their nose at it. For example player deaths and the 10% XP loss. At level 70 this is no big deal and you won’t think much of it. Once you reach the upper 80s and into the 90s you are going to start losing hours and hours of gameplay and it just gets exponentially worse. For me this was most common when mapping with friends and 9 times out of 10 I wouldn’t even be able to see what killed me and maxing out resists does not guarantee you won’t still get one shot by something you never even saw coming. The level of visual noise is so incredibly high that it just isn’t possible to see everything that could kill you. I can live with it when it is my mistake and I just got lax. When the player is not given the opportunity to try and avoid it then it becomes a design flaw.\\n\\nPlayer to player item sales early on were ok, it was quick, efficient and most players were polite enough to let you know if the item you DMed them about was currently being sold so you didn’t waste your time waiting on them to respond. Over time a shift took place and people stopped communicating and the process became a lot of refreshing the page waiting for the market to update so you could see if they sold the item to someone else. Instead of being able to just pay an intermediary system this system requires the player to be online, it requires the player to stop what they are doing to meet up and it requires that you don’t miss a message in your chat log which is very easy to do when mapping. It seems like it was perhaps designed to push players to engage with each other but unfortunately it winds up being just as impersonal as an automated marketplace and far less efficient. It even goes so far as to clash with mapping mechanics. When you generate a map with a waystone you get a limited number of portals to access the map. Every time you leave the map and go back it consumes a portal. Due to limited inventory space it is very easy to consume most or all of your portals just retrieving loot. Leaving a map to meet with a player and sell an item will consume one of these portals making it the wise choice to finish the map first which can often result in a missed opportunity to sell something as the buyer often hedges their bets by DMing multiple sellers with similar items.\\n\\nAscension trials are terrible. Period. The honor mechanic in Sekhemas punishes melee classes while making it easy by comparison if you are ranged. Trial of Chaos will often present you with such terrible debuff options that synergize with each other so strongly you can wind up forced into an unbeatable trial. It should always be possible to get through it! This is another place where the game can completely waste your time and provides absolute nothing but frustration in return.\\n\\nThe list of problems this game has goes on but I’ll just conclude by saying that if you value your time and don’t want to invest in a game that has no respect for the limited time we all have on this earth then look elsewhere for your entertainment.\\n', 'timestamp_created': 1740262549, 'timestamp_updated': 1740262549, 'voted_up': False, 'votes_up': 410, 'votes_funny': 21, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.805609524250030518', 'comment_count': 23, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': True, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}\n",

This game is a trap, but a slow one. You strat and it is all good. Hack and slash, lots of maps, monsters, items and all. The amount of skills - active and passive - is huge and it allows to create mad amounts of builds. So far so good. Graphic and sound is good too, performance is not bad. You play some, level up few times, grab some loot and kill some bosses. It is fun and all. But sooner that later you discover few things about the game mechanics, and the more you play the more you notice. First you will discover that gold is useless and can\\'t be used for anything else than respecing your build. Then you will discover than than all of the magic items are useless trash and it is only used to create orbs. Then rare items become useless, unique items too, so you turn all of them into shards, so you can turn them into orbs... So, you may ask yourself: \"from where do I get any good loot?\". The only way to get items in this game is to buy it from the market (1999 style, it is not integrated with the game, full of trolls, scammers, fake offers).

Please take note you only have 4 bosses to choose from.\\n\\nOption 2:  Mapping - unfortunately because all of the real money transactions going on all good maps and tablets are grossly overpriced. In order for you to purchase them you need to have them in order to juice your maps.  It's a fun option but gets ridiculously boring and once your past lvl 96 and the 1 floor death mechanics make you want to pull your hair our when you die from lack of sight with Delirium fog.\\n\\nOption 3: The Trial of Sekehmas is a lot of fun, but a massive time commitment, and if you get dealt bad cards your in for a brutal ride and potential massive time waster as when you die you lose exp, items, and time commitment.

I spent countless hours buying, rolling, trading, or just buying and trading.  It was generating about 100 divs per day for about 4-5 days but it was boring and manipulative.  I wasn't working for this gear.  I was just taking advantage of people who didn't know pricing, so I stopped that.\\n\\nI continued to play from 91-96 just with strictly trying to find currency myself, but it was useless.  The market continued to rise, and things I was wanting to purchase for 20-30 div were now 200-300 due to inflation from real money transactions.  I saw all my buddies getting temporarlis, 90+ adorned jewels, and perfectly rolled gear and was so confused because in any other game I play with them I'm always +S Tier and their maybe +A.\\n\\nThen I heard the acronym 'RMT' and never heard that before so I inquired to learn they all buy their Divines.  It all started to make sense... as the market continued to age the more divines were found with people who sell for real life currency so I checked and it's insane.. no wonder these items that take me 3 weeks to collect the divines for sell for such a high price.

However, after returning post-drama and noticing that the weapon nerfs weren't just reverted, but changed into buffs, I've decided it's time to give this its proper due.\\n\\n\\n Helldivers 2 is a team based PVE shooter in which you face a variety of enemies, ranging from bugs and robots to zombies. Each type of enemy has its own strengths and weaknesses, and you are granted a wide array of tools to deal with problems. There are rocket launchers for heavy armor, fire for persistent insects, and machine guns for zombies. You can take any of these tools against any threat to test them, pry at defenses and find your own ways to crack their armor and thin their advance. This isn't like most team games where you get one life, and then you make a mistake and now it's up to your team to win without you. There's no cheap grab mechanics that force you to play with others, otherwise you get instantly killed with no counterplay. The game instead allows complete freedom in your approach, and throws merciless hordes at you. Contrary to most team games, this one is perfectly playable solo, as the enemy presence is scaled to the number of people present. If you play solo you will get five lives, and upon exhausting the final life there will be a timer until it is replenished. The game currently has ten difficulties, each ramping up in a creative and interesting way, requiring you to beat them in order to unlock the next one up. I would heavily advise against playing with experienced players on higher difficulties until you've managed to unlock them for yourself, as they are quite excellent at teaching you the game's mechanics one at a time and then ramping them up. Difficulties 0-5 will teach you how to deal with basic enemies, difficulties 6-9 will teach you how to manage heavies, and difficulty 10 is a test of all of that at once. Most people aren't going to have fun solo beyond 8-9 until they've racked up a few hundred hours, but that means you always have something to look forward to and are never bored. With constant content updates bringing more guns (though they are paid not free most of the time), you'll never run out of things experiment with, even if you play the game like a full time job. There's also a unique mechanic in the form of 'strategems', which are basically grenades that cause different effects. So instead of an explosion, a grenade can call down an airstrike or a freaking mini-nuke. They have cooldowns, but you get up to four per loadout, and some of them have multiple uses per cooldown. There is absolutely no shortage of action and fun to be had, there's no 'oh well you used the super gun now you gotta use the basic rifle for ten minutes'. Nope, the game is balanced around heavy, massive barrages of artillery and laser beams the size of buildings being applied constantly. And while that may make it seem as though your guns would be overshadowed, this couldn't be further from the truth. There's grenade launchers, six foot long rifles anti-material rifles that require you to brace to shoot them, and even cooler stuff to keep bringing the pain. If you want to hold down the trigger and never stop, you can do that. Hate ammo management? There's a supply pack to allow you to supply yourself at will four times (yes, from zero to full four times) with a few minute cooldown, meaning that you will NEVER experience a shortage. There's heals given to you in the form of 'stims', which function to keep you alive without the need to search for medkits or other tedious items. You get to just shoot, stim yourself up, throw grenades and bring utter mayhem to enemies. The game's never a chore, you'll never feel bored and there's so many difficulty settings you can tune the experience perfectly. I initially wasn't sure if they'd go back on the nerfs, but since they have..this is literally the best zombie shooting, war simulating game there is. It will probably be that way for ten years or longer, it's a masterpiece in its current state. The biggest selling factor for me is that this game is playable ENTIRELY solo, and it's not even tedious, it's fair. \\n\\nIf you like shooters and aren't sure, please pick this up.

Whether it's a raging storm with rolling surf and rising water, an eerie quiet foggy day or just a beautiful sunset, it's pretty easy to get lost in the atmosphere of this game, especially when you're snuggled up indoors cooking roast deer over a hearth whilst rain pelts down outside.\\n\\nThe game progression tied to boss encounters gives you the carrot on a stick to keep moving forward which is certainly challenging at times, but gives you a reason to grind out gear levels to get stronger.\\n\\nThat said, grinding out said gear doesn't automatically equate to success and the inevitable corpse run back to claim your loot whilst also getting a skill drain punishment feels like a tedious gameplay mechanic that doesn't really encourage risk taking or exploration.  After having to do this a few times, you'll likely start looking up YouTube boss strategies to cheese the encounters as the bosses (whilst looking impressive) are all the usual bullet sponges that are 'weak to X weapon' which is often boring and cliche.\\n\\nWhilst some people thrive on the machonistic challenge of these sorts of mechanics and chase that 'win against the odds' a-la-Dark Souls, the rest of us just want to build pretty castles and go fishing.  It's a tough world being a viking and Valheim will certainly put your skill and patience to the test, but the rewards are there if you can stick with it.\\n\\nMake no mistake, this game is a brutal survival game experience.  It's punishing and often times frustrating, but has gameplay hook that makes it hard to just not give it one more go.  The world presentation is great, the atmosphere excellent and the general 'vibe' of the viking experience is captured well.\\n\\nI have a few hundred hours logged on Valheim on Xbox (Series X) and now play on PC.  The game plays well on both systems, but of course if you have a good PC you can really take this game to the next level on presentation and performance.  Whether you're a controller or KBM player, this game has you covered and it even plays well on Steam Deck (which I have).  One of the benefits of such a small game install that punches above it's weight.\\n\\nThis is certainly a good game in the genre and hits many notes to make this one an easy recommendation (especially on sale), just be ready for the inevitable progression roadblocks and tedious grinding mechanics which can be make or break for you depending on your preferred playstyle.  Valheim is a test of endurance as much as it is skill with some encounters making you feel like you were unfairly treated, but you'll be hard pressed not to want to grit the teeth and give it one more go.  \\n\\nRecommended.\", 'timestamp_created': 1739853582, 'timestamp_updated': 1739914696, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 41, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.783750712871551514', 'comment_count': 1, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': True, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}\n",

Anyway, I think I have a pretty good Idea about the gameplay loop at this point: \\n- You get into a new biome and get your arse handed to you by the new mobs. \\n- You start the tedious process of mining and gathering the new resources. This usually drags out a few hours since most gear is abysmally expensive. At this point you\\'ll get the feeling that this is just to squeeze the last bit of playtime out of the few bits of new content that are actually there.\\n(- if you\\'re insane enough to not activate teleporting metals in standard portals you\\'ll be ferrying your ressources across the ocean a few times. Add another half hour per trip.)\\n- Once you\\'re strong enough to navigate the new biome somewhat routinely, it\\'s time to think about the next boss. However, you have to find him first. For some bosses, I literally had to scan six or seven biomes. I searched four or five hours for Yagluth and online discussions imply that I was lucky to find him that quickly.

The build system was a little hard for me to understand but when you get the hang of it, it's just so satisfying.\\n\\nCombat is simple but fun, with a variety of weapons and enemies that keep you on your toes. The game also knows when to let you relax, whether you’re sailing across the ocean or just enjoying the view from your base (i love to do that).\\n\\nEven after 100 hours, I’m still discovering new things and having a blast. Valheim is a game that keeps giving, and I can’t recommend it enough. If you’re into survival games, this is a must-play.

In an era where many games focus on realism and hand-holding, Valheim stands out as a breath of fresh air, embracing a PlayStation 2-esque art style that feels both nostalgic and stunning in its own way. The low-poly visuals, reminiscent of RuneScape and The Legend of Zelda, blend seamlessly with its breathtaking lighting and atmospheric effects, creating a world that feels alive.\\n\\nFrom the moment you step into Valheim, the world is yours to explore. Odin may have sent you here, but your fate is in your own hands. Whether you choose to carve out a peaceful existence as a builder, fisherman, and farmer or venture into the wilds to challenge the game’s mythical beasts, Valheim offers a deep and rewarding sandbox. Progression follows a gear-based system similar to Terraria, where gathering resources and crafting better equipment is the key to surviving its many dangers.\\n\\nOne of Valheim’s greatest strengths is its dynamic world. One moment, you're lost in the serenity of chopping wood, fishing by the shore, or listening to the ambient sounds of the wind and water. The next, the ground trembles beneath you as trolls emerge from the forest, threatening everything you’ve built. These unexpected moments make every playthrough feel unique and immersive. The game doesn’t hold your hand—it encourages creativity, perseverance, and a true Viking spirit.\\n\\nValheim is best with friends, and captures a sense of adventure and camaraderie that other survival games lack. Whether solo or with friends, the game thrives on emergent storytelling—epic battles, daring raids, and tales of survival that rival those of legendary sagas.\\n\\nFor those seeking a survival game that values atmosphere, challenge, and freedom, Valheim is a must-play. It’s not just a game, it’s a journey, and one that you’ll want to relive time and time again.\\n\", 'timestamp_created': 1740720539, 'timestamp_updated': 1740720539, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 1, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.52173912525177002', 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': True, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}\n",

No story, no real objectives aside from \"get higher level, unlock all crafting options in the level skill tree, beat all bosses, capture all pals\". And the road there is incredibly grindy and sometimes downright boring. Constantly you have to micro manage your inventory and your bases. It often feels more like Factorio meets Rust than Pokemon meets Zelda Breath of the Wild. To get better armor, weapons, and spheres to capture pals, you usually need to craft them yourself. For that, you need to micro manage the shit out of your base(s) and your pals to make sure everything gets produced in sufficient quantities. Sooner or later you will also need to spend hours breeding pals to get 4 stars (116 pals sacrificed to get 4 stars which boosts the stats of one chosen pal basically. you need to repeat this process for many pals), to get good IVs (hidden bonuses that influence how much attack, defense and hp they gain per level) and target perks (stuff like +30% attack, defense, workspeed etc). I have probably spend more time building bases, carrying resources, and breeding pals than on exploration and combat. It often feels more like work than playing a game. Even 154 hours into the game I still havn\\'t beaten the last tower boss because I\\'m not strong enough yet, and there is still a lvl 60 oil rig, and several summoning raid bosses that are even stronger. But I don\\'t feel like breeding specific pals and farming souls and all the other stuff that\\'s necessary to come up with the perfect roster of pals for each of those challenges anymore. You spend 10-30 hours preparing for a single fight that is over in 10 minutes or less if succesful. How is that fun for anyone? I will say this much you can spend a lot of time in this game, and the exploration and even base building is decent if you\\'re into that sort of thing.

Off rip, in order to get good pals early game, typically getting eggs is a good strategy, as the legendary tier ones tend to give you more powerful pals, but even then, waiting 2 hours for one fucking egg? Like why even do that, there is no added benefit of making your players wait literal hours for one egg, it just makes the game play that much more tedious. Another issue being, some terrain in the game is janky as fuck, namely the Astral mountains and volcano area, I ran into numerous areas where I would just be climbing in midair or not even be able to climb a spot at all and just be completely soft-locked. \\r\\n\\r\\nEntering into mid-game was fairly fine, aside from the aformentioned issues, it was pretty good, i like the addition of the breeding farm in order to automate egg hatching as well as the new ores like Refined ingots and Palmetal ingots, not super tedious to grind for, but the thing is, to get to that point, I already resulted to cheating and adding the option in the world settings for more pals in one base, and more bases in general. But once I got into late game, that when shit became unbelievably unbalanced.\\r\\n\\r\\nI decided that I decent pals, so I decided to go and try and catch my first legendary, Frostallion, now keep in mind, my pals were all known to be the strongest for their element, Jormuntide and Anubis were my strongest at the time, and my ass got completely beat, everything I fought up until now was super easy, the jump was actually insane. So I decided that maybe I should upgrade my pals beforehand, and at this point I decided that I was not gonna wait hundreds of hours to hatch all these eggs that are needed to both get optimal traits and to rank up a pal, so i decided to just use a software called Paledit that essentially lets you change any trait in a pal, so using that I went on to defeat all the legendaries, clear all of Feybreak, the hardest area in the game in my opinion, and using those legendaries, i defeated all of the BASE level tower bosses, after this I decided to fight a boss that I've seen many people say is extremely difficult and even unbalanced, Blazamut Ryu, now in order to beat this boss fight, I used 9 maxed out pals of all elements, including the legendaries, and with all that combined I was able to take it down with only my Jetragon remaining.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo at this point, I've had to cheat in more base pals, more bases, and all the stats on my pals. After this, I decided, why not take on the hard level bosses, of which I unlocked after beating the fifth tower bosses. So I, stepped into the first tower boss in hard mode, and it had 10 times the hp, had minions and likely did way more damage as well, because all those maxed out pals that I ordinarily would've had to spend hundreds of ours getting, died instantly, did dick all against it. So after this, I decided to see how other people do this, and there was a single strategy using Knocklems that I tried out, beat the first tower boss, and found out I had to get legendary tier weapons to stand a chance, so i decided to do one of the three oil rigs that can be found on the map, namely the Lv 60 one, and considering all my pals have defeated lvl 60 bosses fairly easily before, I thought this wouldn't be very hard, and to my surprise, all my pals did no damage, AND keep in mind, by the time I fought the hard level tower boss I had my damage output changed from the prior 0.5 to 5 and damage taken changed to 0.1 multiplier, and afterward I found out there is a boss at the end with more than double the amount of hp as Blazamut Ryu, the boss that took out all my pals.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo to summarize, maxed out pals, known as the strongest in the game, 5x damage multiplier and 0.1 damage multiplier taken, and I still don't stand a chance against anything late game? There's clearly a problem here, the fact I was so addicted to this game shows it has potential, but the fact it made me never want to play it again so quickly shows that it needs some serious balancing for late game, in addition, most players of seen online who have beaten these things, had to result to cheesy strats, or a single strategy, or doing just as i did and changing the world settings, if bosses in your game can only be beaten by cheese, cheats, or a singular strategy, then there is a problem here, it really makes it less fun in the sense you don't have the freedom to do what you want to do to win, you either follow the meta or lose.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd one other thing I forgot to mention, the drop rates on some items is insane, both in the chance of obtaining them and how many they give you, for example you need 30 ancient cores to make the best shield in the game, and you get 2 from the Blazamut Ryu fight, as well as the fact that getting a blueprint for a weapon needed to even stand a chance against all these bosses, is a 3 percent drop chance from one of the legendaries, that only respawns every 1 hour.\\r\\n\\r\\ntl:dr  Game is borderline impossible late-game in hard-mode, wait until full release if your a completionist, wait until release or use cheats to get achievements easily, if your not, then early to mid game is pretty fun.\", 'timestamp_created': 1742151741, 'timestamp_updated': 1742151741, 'voted_up': False, 'votes_up': 2, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.545454561710357666', 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': True, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}\n",

With 910 hours clocked across FS15, FS17, FS19 and FS22, last of which completely revolutionized my FS experience, I decided to support the developer. The launch was less than smooth…\\n\\nFirst and foremost - it ran like crap, I barely managed to squeeze out consistent 60 frames. And there were a lot of bugs initially, many of which are still present three months after launch, albeit to a lesser degree. Using any kind of loader with a pallet fork or a bucket is still bound to get sucked in the abyssal depths of the bug realm for no apparent reason. Same goes for being hatefucked out of the map boundaries at fractional mach, with your combine (that you cannot recover unless you revert to a previous save) for no apparent reason. The vehicle fleet available on launch, even with the MacDon pack which I got for preordering the game, is insultingly small compared to the previous titles. Precision Farming was not featured (credit where it is due, they never claimed it would be) and is only now being worked on, and I fear it may be locked behind a paywall when it releases. Personally I would have been much more interested in Precision Farming than the NPC dialogue system that nobody asked for. Base maps didn’t seem too interesting, and Zielonka was suffering from the square field syndrome.\\n\\nThat being said, it was not all bad. The tractors and other aggregates you use actually feel like they have weight behind it. The mud filled tires making fieldwork more difficult during the rain makes the experience more enjoyable. AI can finally be relied upon without downloading mods, and the steer assist is a big QoL addition. Being able to use grazing with livestock also eases up the grindy cycle of mowing, baling and fermenting. I’ve yet to toy around with rice and field flooding but it clearly shows innovation.\\n\\nFS25 gets a lot of undue hate from people who expect their modded FS22 experience in a relatively fresh release, but a lot of them also make a fair point in regards to Giants Soft work ethic. Having a big modding community is a boon to any game and it prolongs its life span immeasurably, but relying on modders to do your work for you, without the effort coming from developers end is a slippery slope and paints Giants in almost Bethesda-esque light. And well, we see how well that idea is going for them. Having a grand modding community isn’t an excuse to cut corners - it should be a motivation to innovate and create and I hope they realise that before it is too late. With piss poor commercial practices and dwindling community support they will only doom the series.\\n\\nI won’t be preordering the next title in the series, that is sure. At the current state of the game, it's still way off the full price tag in my opinion. The game is fun enough to play and the modding scene is picking up (hopefully Szapkowo drops soon), so not all hope is lost.

Developed by Studio Wildcard, this title delivers a thrilling experience that keeps players hooked for hundreds of hours. With its core game and expansive DLC content, ARK offers a remarkable journey that challenges your instincts and ingenuity.\\n\\nCore Gameplay\\nAt its heart, ARK places you on a mysterious island teeming with prehistoric creatures. The game excels in survival mechanics, requiring players to gather resources, craft tools, build shelters, and tame wild beasts to thrive. The challenge scales naturally: early-game struggles with basic sustenance evolve into complex base-building, advanced technology, and thrilling boss encounters. The game's visuals are stunning, with lush jungles, frozen tundras, and sprawling caves creating a breathtaking world filled with danger and beauty.\\n\\nTaming dinosaurs and other creatures is one of ARK's standout features. The process combines strategy and patience, offering rewarding results as you build your army of prehistoric beasts. From the towering T-Rex to the swift Pteranodon, each creature has unique skills that can support combat, farming, or transportation.\\n\\nExpanding the World with DLC\\nThe DLC expansions enhance ARK with new biomes, creatures, and lore, ensuring the adventure never feels stale:\\n\\n**1. Scorched Earth**\\n- This desert-themed expansion introduces extreme survival elements, including harsh heat, water scarcity, and devastating sandstorms. The addition of wyverns as tameable flying beasts adds an exhilarating twist to exploration and combat.\\n\\n**2. Aberration**\\n- Set in a massive, irradiated cave system, Aberration demands adaptation to its vertical environment and unpredictable hazards. The glowing, alien-like bioluminescent zones are visually mesmerizing, while creatures like the Rock Drake and Reaper King offer unique traversal and combat strategies.\\n\\n**3. Extinction**\\n- A post-apocalyptic Earth setting introduces titanic creatures known as Titans, adding grand-scale battles to the game's experience. The addition of enforcer robots and corrupted enemies enhances the sci-fi aesthetic.\\n\\n**4. Genesis Part 1 & 2**\\n- These narrative-driven expansions introduce mission-based progression, adding structure to ARK's typically open-ended design. New creatures such as the Magmasaur and the shape-shifting Shadowmane elevate the gameplay experience. Genesis Part 2 especially expands the story with engaging lore and memorable characters.\\n\\n**5. Fjordur, Lost Island, and Ragnarok**\\n- These free expansions provide sprawling new landscapes inspired by Norse mythology, tropical islands, and icy mountain peaks. Each map offers fresh mechanics, hidden treasures, and unique challenges that keep players engaged.\\n\\nMultiplayer & Community\\nWhether you choose to build solo or join tribes with friends, ARK's multiplayer offers endless replayability. PVP servers test your combat prowess, while PVE servers allow for cooperative survival and base-building on a massive scale. The robust modding community further extends the game's life, adding custom maps, enhanced mechanics, and exciting new content.\\n\\nFinal Thoughts\\nARK: Survival Evolved is a captivating blend of survival mechanics, exploration, and immersive storytelling. The expansive DLCs enrich the game with diverse biomes, challenging encounters, and fresh narratives. Whether you enjoy taming dinosaurs, building sprawling fortresses, or facing off against massive world bosses, ARK offers an unforgettable journey that consistently rewards creativity and determination.

This game will suck you in if you let it! However, it can be soul-crushing when someone comes through and raids your base when you've spent hours crafting/taming/obtaining equipment/dinos/inventory, etc. So be prepared. Not for the faint of heart in that regard.\\n\\nThe funny thing is, I never joined a clan or got mega serious into building super structures or breeding really. Didn't even try to finish all the bosses. It would be fun for sure, but I found it was enough for me just messing around on PVP servers, causing mischief and chaos(that's what they're for), coming up on some loot, usually solo, sticking to mid level equipment mostly, due to lack of time and manpower. (top tier is possible, just tedious while solo and not entirely necessary)\\n\\nThat being said, simply crafting, hunting around for dinos, resources, scoping bases to plan your next heist lol can keep you quite occupied. \\nI personally enjoy the initial new game build up/grind almost as much as the rest of the game, but that's me.\\nPlaying w friends is the ideal scenario, you can get more done and reach higher tier equipment MUCH faster. You can also just poke around on a PVE server where your only enemy is the world around you.\\nThe game is flexible in that regard.\\nServers are still up and are active enough where you can still find people to work together(or against), but depending on the age of this comment, you might want to check around to be sure.\\n\\nFree Tip for PVP: \\nDownload Dododex app on your phone(Thank Me Later). Stay small(at least at first), build up a discrete little base(and stash spots w decoys), and eventually you'll have built up enough materials for a trusty homemade grenade! Three of those puppies can take down a reinforced door. Go nuts! Just be careful who you mindlessly attack.

Probably to some it\\'s last, but let\\'s not go there today. The important part is Skyrim is all about the side-quests. The main story, much like Oblivion, is fairly plain as bread. \\n\\nYour discovered to be a dragonborn, you go to talk to a bunch of old men on a cliff, they teach you how to shout at people off said cliff, you shout them off said cliff, and then proceed to shout at dragons, people, places, and towns folk for the remainder of your play through.\\n\\nNo seriously you probably will use that shout more than any other, it\\'s gold. But the main story is hardly important. it\\'s fun sure, but nothing impressive. Side-stories are where the game shines. You\\'ll run across mages that will try and take over the world, werewolves, vampires, mud-crabs, a town of insane people, books that will try and attack you, ghosts and ghouls in various dungeons and archives, falmer, druids, the undead, secret assassination plots, people trying to talk to the gods, and plots to overthrow the kingdom.\\n\\nSo ya, there\\'s a lot. I wont spoil anything specific and iv kept the best ones hidden so if your interested in THIS then you\\'ll be interested in general.\\n\\nId like to also to take note to the world building too here and music. Both are, if you were living under a rock (or just born) nearly legendary at this point. I\\'m not sure why either. Some say it\\'s over hyped, but I played it when it first came out ages ago and I can say with confidence that the notes still hit the same then as they do in 2025. Something just feels right when walking around Skyrim. To the music fitting the theme or mood, to the world\\'s trees, plants, animals, and even the monsters. The world really feels alive, well built, and crafted with consideration to how it would really look if you were to throw yourself into the pages of a Bethesda world from all their fancy concept art and lore. \\n\\nSometimes I nearly forget where I am, until a wolf comes around and starts nibbling at my shoes.\\n\\n\\nSo, that\\'s a brief idea of what Skyrim is. I hope it does some justice. The game is still fantastic despite the clear age gap at this point, but modding on better sites than the in game mod assistance can go a long way to help that, if your willing to put in the fuss of modding at all.

When these points won\\'t trigger, the zeds won\\'t spawn and you won\\'t be able to complete the quest. \\nThis happened to me 3 times in 2 days. \\nNow bear in mind, tier 5 quests are only in specific locations, and probably a fair distance away from your base.\\nSo you\\'ll have to drive 2-5 miles, spend over an hour clearing a 15 story building or a school, only to realise at the end of it that something isn\\'t right cause the quest won\\'t complete.\\n\\nFirst of all, in my opinion, a mechanic like these \"trigger points\" shouldn\\'t exist in a game like this in the first place as it completely negates the feeling of freedom and obliterates any use of stealth.\\nSecond, if you do decide to implement this mechanic, at least make sure it\\'s working as intended.\\nA bug like this shouldn\\'t exist in a 1.2 version of a game.\\n\\nThe combat.\\nCombat is mostly sluggish. Trying to hit enemies with melee weapons can be as hard as hitting them with guns.\\nMostly because of how these Rushy McGee\\'s move.\\nAs I mentioned earlier, it\\'s mostly boring 1 tapping them in the face, but the ones who don\\'t die from 1 hit immediately become annoying cause of the dodgy movement and the attack animation bug.\\n\\nIt\\'s a solid open world survival game with good crafting mechanics but I would only recommend if you hate being stealthy and don\\'t mind the bugs I mentioned.', 'timestamp_created': 1740915255, 'timestamp_updated': 1740915255, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 56, 'votes_funny': 5, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.795636177062988281', 'comment_count': 1, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': False, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}\n",

What does that mean? Instead of simply spawning in a world and doing your best to survive, you must go through the developer\\'s intended experience, doing the same repetitive tasks from the very beginning. See that house over the road? Well that\\'s no longer a house thats now a \"POI\" aka Dungeon. Its full of scritped zombies that\\'ll pop in as you walk the inteded path, or bug out if you don\\'t.\\nWant to get some clean water? well collecting and boiling water was considered too easy and not RPG enough, so now drinking water results in the character eating the glass jar and you flat out cant collect dirty water anymore. Why? The developers implemented a new water filtering station. You need to have read enough magazines  to even get the crafting workbench and, along with whatever the water filtering station requires as well.\\nYou hardly progress by simply exploring, looting and surviving anymore, instead, as soon as the game starts, you are forced to find a trader (even if theyre kilometers away) and start questing for them. This will send you to a random hou- Sorry, POI, respawn all the scripted zombies and loot inside and let you do the intended path until you complete the dungeon-POI and progress that specific trader a little. \\nThen you do it over and over until the trader decides you are worthy of doing the same POI clearing quests but for someone else, they send you far away into a new biome where you start doing the same. Rinse and repeat, thats the game now. Hope you like walking back and forth between your house, the trader, the dungeon and back. \\n\\nAs a result, everything feels fake and scripted. Your character\\'s growth is determined by eating magazines, zombies, loot found and rewards are affected by a lootstage, you can simply reset houses. Instead of zombies roaming the world there\\'s just a couple on ground level and most spawn inside the POI using invisible triggers. the world just doesn\\'t feel natural.

You\\'d expect it to have lots of game changing mechanics but no, Only ruining the armour system and skill/crafting system. Maybe its too much to expect but it really isn\\'t when you decide a nothing update to be 1.0 so you can jack up the prices by almost double and force people on console to buy the game again because of their own incompetence. Seriously console was being told that so they will have update parity with pc from memory they were 5 alphas behind which is about 6-7 years behind, but 1.0 means you can now buy your way to the update instead of being abandoned! don\\'t worry people who owned the game before got a whole 25% off on a game that they already paid for and now that the game has had a price increase of 45% they are still paying more that what they did originally.\\n\\nOptimisation is so horrendously bad. I guess I get it, you\\'ve be writing spaghetti code for 11+ years now and its just to far gone. But on the other had you love to rework what doesn\\'t need to be reworked, I mean I\\'ve seen multiple updates that were \"guys this alpha the burnt zombie is now hd!\" There was a whole alpha for jiggle physics... which reminds me I feel like there is a few things that make me thing how childish are you to put this in. \"Bong\" as a car brand, strippers and their excessive jiggle physics, extremely corny named shops and having a face option to look like Danny Trejo which I doubt they asked to have his likeness in the game. \\n\\nCharacter customisation is terrible, you get to select from a poorly laid out list of tabs. All colours from skin tone to hair are preset named colours so for skin tone you have white, native, black or asian. Eye colour is from eyes00 to eyes34, not labelled as the colours they are and hairs is the same. You might think that oh well you\\'ll probably be wearing armour so you can\\'t see your customisation anyway and you\\'d for the most part be right but they have removed arguably what I though was the best mechanic of this game, the armour has been severely downgraded instead of getting to choose the specific pieces of armour. Armour pre 1.0 was broken into helmet, glasses, face, coat, chest armor, shirt, arms, pant armour, pants and boots. So you could mix and match, get your style but now its has been reduced down into head, chest, legs, feet. And now clearly all armour is obsolete and you should go for the nerd armour so you get more XP and a chance to get a whole bonus skill point on level up.\\n\\nThey changed skill points and I will say its probably better for a solo but its a nightmare for a group. Now instead of people organising what profession or what their build will be by choosing with skill points to unlock crafting. You have to collect skill books (and alot of them) to get crafting unlocks meaning you need to track who needs what book, what books you can use for yourself and then a storage just incase someone wanted that book. books help unlock crafting of specific items like handgun book for handguns ect, but there are so many books and you need something like 40 of them to unlock everything in a tree and more you unlock of specific thing the higher level you can craft. Which brings me onto legendary or level 6 items. They weren\\'t exactly hard to get but not easy before 1.0 but now you need a legendary part which are exceedingly rare or exceedingly expensive and you never want to use the ones you get because what if its not any better or you hold on until you get the next tier of item.\\n\\nQuesting is boiled down to fetch, kill, flick a switch or dig for 10 minutes looking for a container which by the way doesn\\'t care if it spawns under the road. Quest are extremely repetitive and a necessary thing to keep ahead of scaling because you can\\'t rely on rng of houses to give all loot, instead you need rng on the traders. One of the big notes of 1.0 by the way was each biome has a different trader... because thats ground breaking technology.\\n\\nThese devs truly are the masters of promising and not delivering ever since I brought the game back in 2018 they have been saying that bandits are looking good and that they will be in the next update but every time an update would come out there was no bandits, time and time again always \"next update\". From memory they did add bandits I believe in alpha 14 and removed it shortly.\\n\\nSomething that you\\'ll notice straight away about 1.0 is that EVERY TIME that you open the game it will show an advertisement for the next game... every time, no way to say don\\'t show this again. sure its easy to skip past but are you fucking kidding. Do something like risk of rain 2 where they promote their dlc on that main menu as a small but noticeable  floating tab. It feels so slimy to have an advertisement on another game that takes up the whole screen when you are still updating this game with a road map... in 1.0... with bandits and one of those \\'milestones\\'. Something I forgot to mention, weather. Weather in 7 days has always been almost non existent sometimes its foggy sometimes low quality jpeg of a rain drop = rain. But the point I\\'m getting to is you used to need specific clothes for different climate, cold makes you freeze and heat makes you more dehydrated. honestly pretty boring system and you didn\\'t have to care for it at all. But with 1.0 they removed they whole temperature system. I think its so they can add it back with the current next update which will apparently add \"elemental survival\".\\n\\nI really don\\'t like what they have done with guns in 1.0. It feels like they want they game to be more of a rust pvp thing but they game sure as hell isn\\'t built to support it. It used to be exciting to find a pistol which for some reason would only spawn in toilets but with 1.0 if you haven\\'t found a shitty pipe pistol by your second or third house your having some bad luck. Most animation for pipe weapon are jank, have obvious clipping or just don\\'t work. Gunplay feels very simple and just not good. \\n\\nMultiplayer works... but there\\'s some things wrong with it. Like if you watch someone walk back or forward for less that 5 meters for some reason the proportions of a leg shrinks. If your playing with a group you\\'ll want to make a group so you can see where your friends are and how much health their on. I\\'m not sure knowing the health of each other is a good choice but my biggest problem with this is instead of remembering that you were partied up you have to make a new party and invite everyone, every time you close and relaunch. And relaunching has reminding me of two terrible parts to this game. Not only does it take forever to create a map (something like 5-10 minutes) but it felt like an unfair coin flip on if I was joining would I have to \\'download the map\\' again and that would take 2-3 minutes, It depends on how much you\\'ve explore I assume, we really didn\\'t explore all that much and it was already up to 2 minutes wait time just to launch. I don\\'t understand why I have to download the map or at least the size of the download shouldn\\'t be that big because I\\'m not hosting. I don\\'t know any other game that makes you wait to download the map, I sure as hell ain\\'t downloading a whole world each time i join a minecraft or projectzomboid server. \\n\\nThe other thing that relaunching has reminded me of is this game has a wicked memory leak on top of its horrendous optimisation, having to restart you\\'re game every hour or two hour is very annoying because its a slow fall of frame rate until you can\\'t deal with it anymore. The fact that my high end pc can\\'t get consistent frame rate it bewildering, the fact that 60 fps is a struggle on medium settings and having very consistent stutters on a 3080ti and i9 10850k\\n\\nThe zombies in this zombie game are quite boring. I will admit the different types of zombies are cool but there is zero variety in how they look. The cop will always look like that blue cop, normal zombies will be one of the few selected presets, ect\\n\\nMore to say but, game bad\\n\\n', 'timestamp_created': 1741247243, 'timestamp_updated': 1741247243, 'voted_up': False, 'votes_up': 5, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.543238699436187744', 'comment_count': 2, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': False, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}\n",

Unfortunately, reality often does not match these expectations, making it worth reconsidering before diving into this adventure. Here are some key reasons why ARK: Ascended may not be the best choice for gaming.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Poor Optimization and High System RequirementsARK: Ascended demands an extremely powerful computer, as the game is not well-optimized. Even players with high-end graphics cards and processors often report issues such as frame rate drops, stuttering, and long loading times. If you don’t have a powerful system, playing will be nearly impossible or at least very frustrating.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Frequent Bugs and GlitchesDespite being a remastered release, the game still suffers from numerous bugs. From sudden crashes to data loss – these issues can ruin the entire experience. Developers do release patches regularly, but it seems new problems always arise, making gameplay difficult.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Overpriced CostARK: Ascended is a paid upgrade of a game that was previously available. This means that existing players have to pay a significant amount again for content they ideally should have received as a free update. Additionally, the inclusion of DLCs adds even more financial burden on players.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Poor Developer SupportStudio Wildcard, the game’s developer, has repeatedly shown inadequate community support. They often ignore player feedback, delay promised updates, and fail to address major issues. This reduces trust in the long-term quality of the game.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Outdated and Repetitive GameplayAlthough ARK: Ascended offers visual improvements, the gameplay remains almost the same as in the previous version. Veteran players may quickly get bored since they have already experienced the main content, while new players may not notice significant enhancements that justify the high price.\\r\\n\\r\\nConclusionARK: Ascended could be an excellent game if developers focused more on optimization, stability, and fairness towards players. However, at the moment, the game is overpriced, full of issues, and plagued by poor developer decisions. If you’re not ready to invest a lot of time, money, and patience, it might be better to look for another game.\\r\\n\\r\\n\", 'timestamp_created': 1740410119, 'timestamp_updated': 1740410119, 'voted_up': False, 'votes_up': 137, 'votes_funny': 1, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.83339160680770874', 'comment_count': 16, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': True, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}\n",

I sit atop my father\\'s knee, watching as he plays the version of Spider Solitaire that came pre-installed on the family computer. I watch cards move across the screen and stack on top of each other as they make a satisfying sound akin to a deck of cards being shuffled. Some twenty-odd years and dozens of different card games played later and I now have Balatro, a game whose developer names Solitaire as its most important inspiration. It\\'s almost as if Balatro was made for me... is what I would say if I had a delusional level of self-importance.\\n\\nThe aim of Balatro is simple: play a combination of poker hands in order to score enough points to meet an ever-increasing threshold each round. The reward for beating a round is some $$$ and the chance to shop for packs, tarot cards, planet cards, and the famous Jokers which you can purchase to empower your run. Each run is comprised of 8 levels or \\'Antes\\' each with ending with a \\'Boss Blind\\', a high scoring round with an additional  stipulation such as \"all heart cards are de-buffed\". This all culminates in one final boss blind that you must complete to win the run. From there, you can keep going in endless mode to get high scores or play again with a new deck or at a higher difficulty or \\'Stake\\'.\\n\\nBalatro achieves the singleplayer experience of Solitaire that inspired it but it also feels like a hybrid of a card game and an autobattler at times. Both Balatro and Teamfight Tactics, for example, require the player to manage their economy, take direction from what appears in the shop, use currency to reroll the shop, and know how and when to pivot their build. Just imagine that you replace all the units with cards and the PvP rounds in TFT with a Hearthstone lethal puzzle and you basically have Balatro.\\n\\nBalatro invokes in me the experience that the critic from Pixar\\'s Ratatouille has when he sits down at Gusteau\\'s and takes that first bite. He is served a common peasant\\'s dish, one that reminds him of his earliest years, and yet it is executed on so masterfully that the dish, to him, feels fresh and new. This game serves me something that is familiar on the surface; a standard deck of 52 cards accompanied by a series of snaps and clicks that throw me back to sitting atop my father\\'s knee. Beneath the top layer lies a court of jesters and fools that breathe life into the humble playing card and I am invited to taste and savour all of the game\\'s possible combinations. What I am left with every time I put Balatro down is a feeling of satisfaction yet a yearning for more. This game is what any hungry card game enjoyer\\'s palette ought to crave. It is, for me, a game that I will always come back to. The one you boot up when there\\'s nothing else to play, or on a rainy Saturday afternoon in early 2025. It is endlessly replayable with so many card and Joker combinations, unlockables, challenges, and difficulties. It can be as relaxing or demanding as you like; as simple or difficult as you require. \\n\\nBuy Balatro and call your dad or perhaps someone else\\'s dad. Tell him about the greatest game you\\'ve ever bought for just $15.', 'timestamp_created': 1741731901, 'timestamp_updated': 1741731901, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 56, 'votes_funny': 8, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.766933321952819824', 'comment_count': 3, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': False, 'primarily_steam_deck': True}\n",

The fun starts immediately, with rapid progression in the early game. You’ll quickly set up miners, belts, and production lines, only to realize that the next upgrade requires a ridiculous amount of resources—forcing you to either expand or just stand around waiting.\\n\\nThe real magic happens when you scale up. Massive power plants, intricate belt systems, and logistics that make your head spin—this is where the game shines. Building is smooth, and working with friends makes the whole experience even better. You can divide work, optimize production, and solve power problems together. Sure, sometimes there are connection issues, but that’s just life.\\n\\nExploration? It’s there, but it’s more of a necessity than a focus. You’ll hunt for power slugs (some easy, some painfully hard to reach), but the world itself doesn’t drastically change as you move across the map—it’s just different scenery. What really matters is where the ores and water are because having to travel for basic adjustments is a pain.\\n\\nConveyor belts are solid, though they can get clogged with unwanted materials, which is annoying to fix. Power management, on the other hand, is one of the best mechanics in the game—you're always pushing for more, and finding new ways to generate it is super satisfying.\\n\\nNow, my biggest gripe? The lack of variety in resources. There’s one main ore that’s used in almost everything, a secondary one that’s kinda important, and the rest are barely relevant. More ores, more recipes, and more ways to create new things would take this game to the next level. Right now, progression mostly just builds on itself instead of branching into new areas.\\n\\nOne last thing—this game is a beast when it comes to performance. If you’re planning to play it for the visuals, be warned. You’ll need a strong graphics card, because even on the lowest settings, weaker PCs will struggle.\\n\\nOverall, Satisfactory is an incredible factory builder with deep logistics, great multiplayer, and endless optimization potential. But it could use more variety in crafting and a smoother late-game experience. If you love efficiency, planning, and automation, this game will hook you for hours.

Time fly so quickly playing this game.  Most of my 414 hour play time is within the last 2 weeks. I just can't stop playing it.  It is definitely worth your money and time.  Unlike another game in this genre which never gives any discount, this game always discount multiple times in a year which makes it even better deal.  From steamdb, the number of concurrent players for this game already tell something. \\n\\nHere are quick tips that I learned from trial and error.  It might not be the 'best practice'.\\n- Focus on unlocking all milestones, tech trees and advance the space elevator level as fast as possible.\\n- The cost to get a coupon increases exponentially.  There is one last achievement (Golden Nut) that requires 1000 coupon to get it.  So, you can imagine how long it take to craft the very last hundreds coupons.  \\n- Try to unlock coal, fuel power plant as fast as you can.  I mainly rely on fuel + coal + power storage and biomass.   With coal power or fuel power, everything is fully automate.   With a large number of power storage devices, I can avoid power outage especially at the near end game stage without using nuclear power plant.  The Particle Accelerator and Quantum Encoder will blow your fuse at the peak power usage.  The ideal locations for fuel power plant are those small islands on the west of the map.  For Coal power plants, it is in the lagoon at the middle of the map.  Build as many as you need there.\\n- Create Geothermal Generator on top of all geysers on the map and wire them back to your base.  It is the easiest power source to build in this game.\\n- Don't worry about items on the top of the tree, high hills until you unlock Hover Pack.  With Hover Pack, I create a wired network everywhere I want to go in the map. \\n- In the middle of the game, Hyper Tube is convenient and fast.  But the best thing is at tier 9 (Portal). This is the tech that you don't need to create track (as in Monorail, Hypertube). \\n- I use work bench to craft something simple and if I need only 50-100 items of it.  But anything beyond that create assembly line to craft it automatically even it is available from work bench.  \\n- Create everything except miner on Foundation.  It is much easier and faster in the long run.  It is one of the achievement too.\\n- Later in game, we will need to scale out certain part of assembly line which will no longer sufficient in the later phase.  I use eleveator to pump to resource to higher floor.  The higher floor sit on a single piece of wall that stack on top of each other until it's higher than anything at the lower flloor.    \\n- Lay a very wide foundation before create lots of things.  It is much more easier to not constaint ourselves on tight space.  Scale out assembly line is much easier and faster on the same floor too.  You cannot grow your factory vertically without foundation too.\\n- When scaling out assembly line, I just look at the output level from previous phase and match it with next phase.  Use spliter for scaling out.  Also check the speed of conveyeur if it can handle.  Upgrade conveyeur when you have faster tech available.  At the game, I use mk.6 conveyeur only to feed coal to produce.  Everything else is mk.5.\\n- Useless tech :- Drone, truck auto pilot, cyber wagon, factory cart, blueprint designer, alien power augmenter, smart splitter, programmable splitter.   Monorail is okay.  Don't purchase anything from AWSOME Shop unless it is needed for achievements.  \\n\\nWith these knowledge, I believe I can cut down >300 hours out of my playtime to get 100% achievement.   However, I think it's better to just chill and enjoy the game.  Play with all the equipments, resources.

You’re handed a set of tools and a pile of resources, and from there, it’s up to you to turn a blank slate into something worth showing off. Whether you’re piecing together towering castles, sprawling cities, or just a humble shack that barely stands upright, the possibilities feel pretty wide open. The early stages are simple enough, with a tutorial that’s there if you need it but doesn’t hold your hand too much. Before long, you’re knee-deep in menus and mechanics, juggling different materials and figuring out how to make things look good without everything toppling over.\\r\\nThe visuals sit in that sweet spot between charming and functional—not groundbreaking, but they get the job done. Sometimes the textures pop in a way that’s satisfying, other times you might squint and wonder if that wall is supposed to look like that. The sound design follows a similar path: ambient noises and clinks of construction keep you company, though nothing’s going to win any awards here. Controls can be a bit of a stumble at first—clunky in spots, especially if you’re not used to this genre—but they smooth out with practice, and soon you’re placing blocks or beams like a pro.\\r\\nThere’s a sandbox heart beating in this one, which is great if you love freedom. You can spend hours tinkering, experimenting with designs, or just seeing how high you can stack things before physics says ‘nope.’ That said, it’s not all perfect. The game sometimes feels like it’s waiting for you to give it purpose—there’s no real story or push to keep you going unless you make one up yourself. Some players might love that, but others could find it aimless, especially when the novelty of building wears thin. There are systems in place to mix things up, like resource management or environmental challenges, but they’re not always as deep as they could be.\\r\\nCommunity-wise, it seems to have its fans. Steam reviews—if you dig into them—swing between glowing praise from people who’ve sunk hundreds of hours into perfecting their creations, and grumbles from folks who found it too slow or repetitive.

Everything that makes this game unique in the genre makes me understand exactly why the genre normally never makes these design decisions.\\n\\nThe first person perspective combined with the [b]enormous[/b] just makes building a simple production line tedious. You're constantly clambering over your machines just to get some high ground so you can build the damn belt lines. Sure they give you an observation to try and help early game, but the platform is static and the belt's you're trying to make are still blocked by the damn machines.\\n\\nThis means building is slow. And worse? The game has standard, free form terrain instead of a set 2d grid or vowel world. Think of the building in this game works like Rust. You build foundation to give you a grid, but you're still at the mercy od the immovable terrain. This isn't a problem in most survival games where your base is reasonable, but Satisfactory wants you to make hundreds of machines for massive scales of automation. You either build the whole thing in the skybox or suffer on the ground with an inherit lack of expandability. The blueprints don't do much to fix expandability because of how limited belt throughput is.\\n\\nAnd god forbid you want to build something that looks nice in this game, because the slow, tedious building only get's worse when you realize everything looks ugly unless if you manually decorate the whole.thing.

Dyson Sphere handles the 3D concept more compellingly and with reasonable physics and geometry. Factorio delivers a far more refined and optimized gameplay experience with much better emphasis on the core factory element. What Satisfactory does that is unique is that it personalizes the experience with exploration and (extremely light) combat, letting you hunt for specific unique items that offer interesting bonuses, as opposed to limiting you only to things you can produce from raw resources. In this sense, it is perhaps easier to get into than other factory games, because it starts off feeling like a first person exploration game. The lack of macro view is frustrating but limits the scope in the beginning, which might benefit new players. \\n\\nIt is ultimately a game about the player as a pioneer, and not the pioneer avatar existing as a way to limit player action range.

A really, really stressed-out robot who’s trying to build a factory the size of a small country, but with absolutely no idea how to make a cup of coffee.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis game starts out innocently enough. You land on an alien planet, and your mission is simple: Make stuff. And then, before you know it, you're designing conveyor belts that could stretch from one end of the galaxy to the other, all while desperately hoping no one walks by your screen and asks what you're doing with your life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s a certain magic in Satisfactory. A magic that starts when you realize you’ve accidentally created a factory complex so large it can only be described as a dystopian nightmare of pipes and belts. The moment you think you’ve “finished” your factory, you realize you’re just getting started. Oh, you wanted to build a simple iron refinery? Sure, let’s throw in 18 levels of scaffolding and over-complicated assembly lines! We need 9000 megawatts of power, but hey, why not add an extra 10 just for fun!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd let’s talk about the animals. They’re mostly harmless, except when they’re charging at you like an angry rhino after you dared to build a factory in their backyard. I guess I don’t mind that much – they’re just upset because I’ve turned their lush home into a sprawling industrial complex. I’ll just continue my mission of creating, while avoiding being eaten by an angry alien deer thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best part? The game doesn’t even hold your hand. Nope. It throws you into the deep end, lets you figure out how to power your entire factory, and then just stares at you with a blank, alien stare when you start crying about running out of fuel for the third time.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion: Satisfactory is a game that rewards your obsession with optimization, fuels your addiction to creating over-the-top conveyor systems, and gives you a deep sense of pride when you finally manage to power an entire factory with nothing but biofuel, crushed dreams, and the faint sound of the distant screams of my character as they fall into the abyss.\\r\\n\\r\\nWould I recommend it?

I have been playing Path of Exile since June of 2012 http://i.imgur.com/jeP6URF.png and have thousands of hours on it.[/h1]\\n\\nIt is among the most amazingly awesome games I have ever played. Coming from Diablo 2: LoD, and the various mods (Valhalla, Eastern Sun, Median, etc) this game is perfect for me. \\n\\n* I will start here, with the things that I enjoy about it.\\n\\n1. Diversity among builds. Want to shoot a thousand exploding arrows per second (Quill Rain + Chain/Greater Multiple Projectiles/Exploding Arrow/Fire Penetration)? Want to blast rays of fire that launch exploding balls of magma (Scorching Ray/Cast While Channeling/ Fire Penetration/ Multiple Projectiles/Magma Orb)? Want to call forth the fury of the heavens with a mighty scepter, smashing your foes into submission (Mjolnir+ Lightning Strike/Arc/StormCall/Spark/Multistrike)? The sheer amount of ways you can go about destroying mobs is limited only to your imagination. \\n\\n2. Story is great, very interestnig, and keeps you entertaining while playing through the game. Unlike other ARPGS of similar play style, Path of Exile is able to effectively deliver a quality story along with the extremely well done gameplay.\\n\\n3. Scenery is dark and grim, gloomy, morbid, and full of gore. From corpse ridden beaches, ancient temples filled with undead and skeletons, destitute crumbling cities, palace cellars flooded with blood - ridden with heaps of corpses and twisted miscreations, echocing crystal caverns of golems and mutated freaks. The variety in enemies and terrain is very broad. \\n\\n4. Item creation, map alteration and creation, uber dungeons. There is plenty of challenge to be had in this game, thus keeping you striving to achieve ever greater power and push yourself ot the absolute limits of your capabilities.\\n\\n5. Infinite replayablity. I have made probably 50+ characters so far, and each one gets progressively more powerful as I understand more about the game, the mechanics, and how to build them effectively. \\n\\n6. Temp Leagues + Ladder. Nuff said.\\n\\n7. Constant expansion and content updates. The game is constantly being updated, minor balance tweaks, additional items, skills, monsters, maps, etc. It\\'s amazing.\\n\\n8. Grinding Gear Games are among the most amazing gaming company. Really really good people and they constantly interact and have dialogue with the playerbase. \"How do you guys feel about X? Does Y feel right to you? If you could change X, what would you do and why?\" etc.\\n\\n[b]I could go on for another thousand lines but I feel as though I got the point across. The game is amazingly fun and addicting.[/b]\\n\\n[h1]Now, for the things that, I don\\'t necessarily \"dislike\" - but things that I feel may dissuade other people from playing the game.[/h1]\\n\\n1. Learning Curve is incredibly steep. Your first 3-5 characters will be absolute trash. You need to do a bit of research on what to do and how to build effectively, otherwise you\\'re probably going to get wrecked hard once you get to a4 merciless. Here is a beginners guide - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEZtq6FSebE&list=PLjlRwdIo6SixoG_Bo5bhKCzZtOMVuVnJZ&index=8&t=8s\\n\\n2. Repetition of acts, 3 difficulties (however, this will be gone come July - TEN ACTS ONE PLAYTHROUGH HYPE!) Going from Normal, to Cruel, and then to Merciless can really put people off. Myself, I\\'m used to it and have done it since d2 so it\\'s just a normal thing for the arpg genre. GGG are going to change that though.\\n\\n3. Item crafting is [b]extremely[/b] expensive. Like, unfathomably expensive. I have never crafted an item before other than throwing an alch and a couple chaos into a rare item. \\n\\n4. Currency is nightmarishly rare. I\\'ve found maybe 4 exalted orbs in my entire time playing this game. Two of them were just within the last week as well. I have only ever owned two 6-link items. Wings of Entropy, and some random rare 2h sword that is garbage. \\n\\n5. poe.trade is the only real way to trade. $Chat is a scam 100% of the time. Once they implement a real trading system other than posting shops online and checking the forums every 3 minutes, or browsing poe.trade for an hour at a time trying to find an item to fill a hole in your build this game will be just shy of perfection.\\n\\nThose are really the only negative things I can think of that might dissuade a player from sticking around... the game is magnificent.\\n\\nI highly, highly suggest you play.\\n\\n[h1]Overall Rating[h1]\\n[b]10/10 - one of my favorite games of all time.[/b]', 'timestamp_created': 1487830856, 'timestamp_updated': 1487872350, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 2, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.541666686534881592', 'comment_count': 1, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': False, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}\n",

The maps feel like they're more so built for looping and chases, which personally I feel makes it harder for new players and non-horror game players to actually enjoy the game. The ghost's AI seem to be a little bit on the sluggish side, since sometimes it takes 20+ minutes to get some of the evidence and the game feels like you need to quite literally study up on every ghost behavior in order to guess the correct ghost. Phasmo is starting to become a game where you can't just pop into the game and just have a good time with friends.

I even bought it years ago for 5 friends. However the development is very lazy at this point. There is absolutely no reason the game is still as basic as it is after all this time. There is only a handful of maps that get stale quite quickly. It somehow takes the devs YEARS to make new ones or like a year to rework an old one... Which is insanely slow... There is a horrible repetitious grind to 'Level Up' that is used for filler because of lack of content. And when you are done leveling there is no reason to keep playing... You've seen everything 100x. (This is coming from someone that Plays nightmare and insanity difficulty usually at this point.)\\n\\n And there STILL is no Unique scares that should of been in the game forever ago like the ghost appearing outside windows and watching you, pictures changing (Eyes blacked out for example) or being destroyed, symbols appearing on walls, floors, the ghost breaking things like windows, tvs or such when P***ed off, etc... Just something that would give some type of intrigue other than ghost manifest sometimes, ghost throws stuff sometimes, ghost moves door sometimes, and that's it!!\\n\\n The ghost implementation and interactions straight up are about as lazy and low effort as can be because apparently the devs want to be able to drop a ghost into a okayish map (that they somehow take two years to make) then do some basic (Usually Buggy) path mapping and call it good. Again as low effort ghost and level design as they can get away with.\\n\\n It is just shameful as the game could be so much more. I've had fun playing, but at this point I just can't recommend it unless it is extremely cheap or the Devs actually decided to start putting some effort into filling out the game some with real content.\\n\\n (On another side note, the lack of support for people being able to make community maps really is holding the game back. Maybe the Devs are just afraid that the community will show how incompetently slow they are working because I guarantee that within weeks we would have a flood of way better designed and thought out maps from the community then the devs shave made in YEARS!!)\\n\\nEdit: Just thought of some other stuff too. The ghost models an animations have been the same for 5 years now too which is all of about 10 of them.\\n\\n And there is about 5 animations of the ghost. Most of the time they are just standing there or sliding across the ground. And the death animation... My GOD... It's been the same stupid 'Guess Who' eye grab animation this entire time too... Like come on...\\n\\n You also have the same 5 (I think) player models to choose from which is confusing especially as there is no customization what so ever and no name tags so if 3 people decide to play their favorite, same model, you literally can't tell who is who.\\n\\n All it would take is for devs to add the ability to wear a different hat, jacket or so forth to fix that issue...

You don't have to (increase richness of ore patches). Don't like cliffs ? Remove them. etc...\\r\\n\\r\\nFifth: Community management.

Compared to the amount you spend on the game, you can easily get that much time of fun or much much more if it is the type of game you like. While many people like to show of their complicated designs and optimized blueprints, for any new player I would recommend trying to make things yourself. The game has a difficulty curve that tries to match your level dynamically. As such, getting ahead of yourself may result in the biters demolishing you and your base because you expanded the factory more than you should have without the relevant preparations. This does not mean that you cannot use other's blueprints, or should not try to build fast, as that is what speedrunners do to great success. And watching others is fun and can teach you a lot saving a lot of grief early on. \\n\\nRegarding the actual gameplay, I cannot recommend the tutorial levels enough to everyone. Even veteran players can find some fun there due to the easter eggs hidden on the map or the many challenges that can be done. As the tutorial is included in the free Factorio demo, anyone can play and see exactly what they are getting into before committing to the purchase. In Freeplay, the Factoriopedia accessed though the menu or clicking alt and left click on any item to see its details, how to make it, how to use it, and how to unlock it. The factoriopedia and the tech tree (I'd recommend only looking at the yellow unlockables initially to avoid being overwhelmed) show you how to progress if you are lost. There is always more to learn, but the game can be very forgiving and with very superficial knowledge of the mechanics you can beat the game. All the bells and whistles come later when you are ready for them. Also, the mods page is your friend, use the quality of life mods as needed for the convenience. \\n\", 'timestamp_created': 1741786040, 'timestamp_updated': 1741786040, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 6, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.577825188636779785', 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': False, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}\n",

The forests feel properly dense and good to navigate. The new building system is better to work, allowing for much more specific manual control to let you engage in more nuanced construction. The inclusion of friendly NPCs was a welcome addition and it worked fairly well. The game ran well with fairly high settings and I played through the whole game with 2 friends and we never suffered a networking or connectivity issue.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe less good:\\r\\nThere were some balancing issues, the more obvious one was the deep inclusion of firearms that make mowing through groups a bit too easy, especially when playing with multiple players. The less obvious balancing issue was the golf cart. When you get at least a bit of speed with the golf cart, it will one-shot most living things in the game. Not necessarily an issue in of itself, but the fact that we found not 1, but 3 golf carts in the first couple hours of gameplay meant that we could just mow down an entire camp, pilfer all the valuables, and drive off and do it again. It basically allowed us to skip the early game difficulty when you are supposed to be more poorly equipped. Though admittedly, driving through dense forest and swerving between trees while blaring techno music was quite a vibe.\\r\\nThe story was a bit less coherent than the first. The build up to the end was fine as they are very shortcoming with the details, forcing you to piece it together yourself, helping with the mystery of it all. The main issue is when you get the final details and put the final pieces of the story together, it doesn\\'t amount to much of anything. Also I agree with my friend who felt like the final boss was \"a wet fart\", resulting in a disappointing conclusion of the game.\\r\\n\\r\\nOddly enough I think people who haven\\'t played the original will probably like this game more than those who did and were looking for a big follow up to the first title. Not an outright bad game, hence the positive review, but in comparison to the first, was a little bit of a letdown.\\r\\n', 'timestamp_created': 1741653568, 'timestamp_updated': 1741653568, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 9, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.621909022331237793', 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': False, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}\n",

Graphically, there are improvements, and I think the game is well-optimized.\\n\\nThat being said, now let’s talk about the weaknesses.

While the visuals are undeniably beautiful and the world is vast, that's where the positives end.\\n\\nFirst off, the combat system, which was touted as one of the game’s main selling points, quickly becomes repetitive and clunky. The flashy action feels exciting at first, but it loses its luster as you progress. There are so many combo inputs, but many of them feel unnecessary and over-complicated, making combat more of a chore than a fun experience.\\n\\nThe game’s biggest flaw, however, is its reliance on an insufferable grind. Black Desert Online throws you into a world where progress feels sluggish unless you either spend hours grinding or cough up real money for microtransactions. The game heavily incentivizes you to buy boosts, enhancing your progression and making it feel like a pay-to-win scenario. The grind is endless, whether it’s for leveling up, gathering resources, or enhancing your gear — it's an exhausting cycle with little reward.\\n\\nThe monetization is another sore point. While free-to-play players can enjoy the game to some extent, they’re constantly hit with a barrage of premium items and time-limited offers. It’s clear that the developers designed the game to push players toward spending real money, and it feels manipulative.\\n\\nThe story? Don’t expect much. It's there, but it’s weak, and I often found myself skipping cutscenes just to move on to the next grindy task. The lack of meaningful narrative makes the entire experience feel hollow.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Black Desert Online fails to deliver a truly satisfying MMORPG experience. Beautiful world and combat visuals are overshadowed by a relentless grind, questionable monetization practices, and a lackluster story. If you’re not willing to shell out extra cash or sink an ungodly amount of time into grinding, this game may leave you frustrated and disappointed.\\nPlayed this game for 6 years, never have i ever seen myself get lucky in anything, game itself is a big scam, it basically just lure people in and make them into a grind machine so Devs can make money out of it. \\n\", 'timestamp_created': 1742158717, 'timestamp_updated': 1742158717, 'voted_up': False, 'votes_up': 3, 'votes_funny': 1, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.526678144931793213', 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': False, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}\n",

This game preaches the phrase \"bridges the gap between arcade shooter and military realism\" I however think it leans more towards the latter, atleast post ICO. This game is not arcade at all, the ICO forces players to communicate and play as a team, not playing with your team penalizes you. Gunplay wise, although I only experienced pre ICO for a few months I can say I like the game how it is now. The game is a lot more slower paced and makes you think about how you manage your stamina or in what position you want to be when you shoot, many would disagree and say it killed the game, however, the numbers speak for themselves. On the other side of the spectrum we have vehicles which in my opinion is what sets this game apart from others, vehicles do not feel overpowered or underpowered, they feel perfect, every vehicle serves a purpose whether you are in a logistics truck carrying supplies to the front line or an IFV helping infantry push a point, it all makes sense.\\n\\n If you are a new player I highly recommend going through the tutorial DO NOT SKIP THE TUTORIAL otherwise you will make people angry in game, there are multiple tutorials that are all extensive and will teach you about every part of the game. once you get the hang of things head into a \"new player friendly server\" as these servers are aimed to help new players get a feel for the game, and don\\'t be afraid to ask questions. Also make sure you read server rules always as every server has different rules.\\n\\nI will say one bad thing about this game just because I am a solo player that is not part of a faction. This game does not have official servers which forces players to play on 3rd party servers often hosted by clans. The problem about this is clan stacking, this means that often times the teams will be divided into one team where everyone is part of a clan and are all probably experienced players that vs one team where no one knows each other. This often leads to teams getting rolled on 5 or 10 matches in a row that all last anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours. This then leads to experienced players on the loosing team changing to the winning side leading to even more losses for the other team. This in my opinion is a major flaw of the game and I think many other solo players would agree.\\n\\nOverall I very much enjoy this game for what it is, I think it is a game that is scary to start playing just because of all the complex mechanics but once you get the hang of it everything becomes fun. 10/10\\n\\nNote: ICO refers to infantry combat overhaul which happened about a year since this review, the overhaul made major changes to stamina and how it affects gun handling making it a lot more \"realistic\" along with other things but this is what most players complained about.', 'timestamp_created': 1740152970, 'timestamp_updated': 1740152970, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 41, 'votes_funny': 1, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.788732588291168213', 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': False, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}\n",

You will hate it for the first 2-3 days. It does a lot of things that modern day games have done away with. It forces you to stare at the fast travel indicator, which moves at the speed of a slug. It forces you into gritty, hard-hitting, claustrophobic combat, which makes you feel like throwing your controller. Save files feel few and far between, so on the rare chance you do die from falling off a cliff, or die to a surprise late-game ambush, you will be set back at least 1 hour in your progress... yet despite all of this, the game is EXCELLENT.\\n\\nThe combat is as simple as this: if enemy has higher stats than you, you die.\\n\\nThis means that if you go into combat with a bandit in full black armor, he will likely parry everything you throw at him, forever. So just don't try it. Even if you try to stealth kill him, he'll throw you off and laugh at you. This is because you are a PEASANT with 5 strength, and he is a MERCENARY with 15 strength. This is DnD style role-play, and the developers did it on purpose.\\n\\nBut once you DO get used to the combat, and as long as you're playing with mouse and keyboard, it is possible to joust with 2-3 bandits at once. Provided THEY ARE THE SAME LEVEL AS YOU. It took me about a week of playing (I tried on console first) to actually get used to the fighting mechanics, but eventually you get to the point where you can reliably duel a small group of bandits with mixed tactics. And you don't need heavy armor to do it, ether. I usually wear a stealth set. Which leads me to say...\\n\\nStealth and thieving feel INCREDIBLE. This is what I wanted from an Oblivion-like stealth/thieving experience. I've hoarded over 5,000 gold in the early game so far just by looting Rattay and the neighboring small towns. And due to the limited save-file system, it always feels tense. Sometimes, you won't even have to load a save if you do get caught because if you have the sense to get up, spin around, and run away from people before they manage to I.D. you, that WORKS. You won't get a bounty and they won't even fine you for trespassing!\\n\\nLikewise, I cleared two bandit camps today using purely Robin Hood tactics. And holy sheet, does it feel awesome! Fire off a piercing arrow, bleed the bandit leader to death, then take out his goons that come running via kiting/picking them off one by one. And don't get me started on going into camps at night whilst they're all sleeping. That feels incredible too!\\n\\nSo, long story short. The game has a few things that can be annoying (looking at you foliage and rain that tanks my FPS). Enemy dogs suck during the mid-game due to their hit-box, but this is fixed by having a dog of your own. (I highly recommend getting the Woman's Lot DLC purely for the dog, as it really does help lessen the dread of the experience somewhat. The dog is OP if handled correctly.)\\n\\nThe last thing I will say is, the main story is tedious. This is the game's worst sin/only 'real' negative. Everything else is alleviated with time, but the story isn't.\\n\\nAll of the quests are detective-style fetch quests with no actual combat. This makes no sense, because you spend days learning how to fight with Captain Bernard. You get some middling armor. Then you think, ''right, I must be ready for the main quests now, let's go;'' but then... you find yourself waddling around in the woods, talking to people and asking ''SO WHeRe DId ThoSe BanDIts gO?''\\n\\nYou are a medieval messenger. The main quests don't treat you like a knight, or a squire. You're an errand boy--and only three of them have combat sequences involved. It's... kind of annoying? And kind of confusing. The developers couldn't think up a better quest line than this? Like, I don't know:\\n\\nThe bandits competing in a grand tournament under disguises and Henry has to win the tournament in order to get back Ser Radrik' sword by beating the bandits one by one in a series of listings, whilst doing this other detective shit along the way(?)\\n\\nJust--you know, something that ACTUALLY used the game's combat system? Instead, the game just makes you waddle around like a numbskull for 6 hours chasing threads. It's really boring/senseless. I feel like their writer crapped out here and I don't know what else to say. The story feels like it has nothing to do with the rest of the game.\\n\\nLast thing--I wish there were more 1v1/2v2 combat situations. There is an itch this game has that bugs you, and I finally identified what it was the other night. You are constantly craving a good scrap.

In 1 on 1 combat, its a lot more manageable and i think that is where Kingdom Come Deliverance's combat system shines. There are many play styles to choose from and many of the perks are double edged swords so its always worth being mindful about how perks can affect you while exploring all that Bohemia has to offer. If you like PRGs with great world building and detailed gameplay than i would recommend Kingdom Come Deliverance but if you are looking for a more casual RPG to play i would look elsewhere.

But out of all the good it has, there is one glaring issue that makes me NOT want to engage with one of the most essential parts of the game: combat\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong, this game does a lot of good. The world is alive with things to do and unique locations. Sasau and Rattay are well designed cities that really make the game look the best I\\'ve ever seem in a game. Bartering for goods and getting deals based on stats that are affect by your cleanliness, status, and just the idea that you are \"royal\" are really cool to play with. \\n\\nAnd to be fair to the combat, the combat is made for open-field, one vs, one combat. Here, the mechanic shines well, and its feels good to time parry\\'s and blows, and build combos that can crack armour and fall opponents.\\n\\nBut the issue is just that; its built for one vs one, open field combat. The combat that will happen quite often however is:\\n\\n3 bandit jump you on the road, if you don\\'t lock onto one, you lock on jump randomly around and you cant land blows. If you lock onto one, the other two run around you and stab you in the back. If you try and run, the AI has far more stamina than you and can easily chase you down. \\n\\nAnd that not even to mention if you have a choice of what you get into, one mission plunks you behind a windmill, surrounded by 5 bandits, and your only hope is really to run or be really over-levelled before showing up. Worst part, you horse is likely not courageous enough, and if you try to use your horse to run, he\\'ll buck you off, and you get stabbed on the ground. \\n\\nMain story missions suffer from this as well. Fighting inside a fortress with dozens of people? Get caught on multiple people trying to stab each other and cant target anything without wildly jumping around. You end up either getting to close and getting jumped by 5 people, or sitting out the battle and letting the AI figure it out. \\n\\nAgain, I don\\'t doubt there are people out there that are quicker with reflex, willing to grind for far longer, or just far more willing to deal with the lock-on system, but I am just so fed-up with it. This might very well be the game for you, and I see I\\'m going against the grain when it come to reviews for this game, just be aware combat in this game is not like most games, and requires a LOT more patients, timing, skill-grinding, and just teeth-gritting to get through the jank of it all.  \\n', 'timestamp_created': 1742103589, 'timestamp_updated': 1742103589, 'voted_up': False, 'votes_up': 1, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.523809552192687988', 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': False, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}\n",

I chose to not recommend the game.  Here are my issues:\\r\\n\\r\\n1)  There\\'s been numerous complaints about the age change.  I\\'m also not a fan, but I can accept that design choice.  But I do have a complaint about the limits on what my 2nd and 3rd age civs are.  If you are going to force me to change civs, don\\'t restrict me to only 2-4 civs to choose from at each age.  \\r\\n\\r\\n2)  UI is terrible about making unit identification easy for the player.   Independent cities all being the same color was a terrible decision.  And running 3 different \"yellow\" player characters was a terrible decision.\\r\\n\\r\\n3)  The \"improvements\" to QoL aren\\'t there.  Supposedly having towns instead of cities makes for less work and thus faster turns.   But in my Civ 5 and 6 games, I generally only own 5 or 6 cities unless I\\'m playing warlord and conquering all my opponents cities.   But here I have 20 towns and cities, all which grow, and have to have buildings purchased, etc.  Yes, you can turn off their growth and give them a mission to limit the popups, but then they are no longer growing and you aren\\'t claiming more territory (more on this below).  Managing 20+ towns and cities is tedious.  \\r\\n\\r\\n4)  Map sizes are too small.   You start with only half the map usable in the Antiquity Age.  With 4 players on what amounts to a \"small\" map from Civ6, you are on top of your opponents within a couple dozen turns.  Then in the Exploration Age, when you open up the 2nd half the map, you find that its already mostly explored and occupied because that\\'s where the other 4 players were on their \"small\" map during the prior age.  But the worst part is that the ocean separating the \"old\" from the \"new\" world turns out to be 2 hexes wide. I literally had borders of my cities touching between continents.  Not much of an ocean.   And this builds into my biggest issue:\\r\\n\\r\\n5)  This game should be called Settlerzation.  It is, in effect, a race to build as many settlements on the map as fast as possible before all the land is sucked up.   With 8 opponents, each with 10-20 settlements, you will reach the modern age with well over 100 towns and cities on the map, and no open territory (not even over the oceans).   This leads to other issues.   You can\\'t have open borders without either being at war or in an alliance with the other player.   So a few well placed cities on the bridge islands between the two continents can effectively blockade most (if not all) player movement between those continents.  This is why its a race to own the land (and sea) because if you don\\'t, then you will get locked out.  \\r\\n\\r\\nMore minor issues:\\r\\n\\r\\n1)  Resources in the first and second ages are fine.  They make sense.   Trade route range is weird to figure out, but for the most part, if you have a resource, you can slot its advantage in one of your towns.   However, come the modern age, 80% of your resources (the ones that gave you bonuses for the past 200 turns of the prior ages) are suddenly only beneficial if you have a railroad and factory, which is about 5 researches deep.   So suddenly you\\'ve got 2 dozen resources (remember, you have 10-20 towns at this point) and most are completely unusable.  Then once you can use them, you get 1 factory per town/city, which manages 1 resource.  I had 30+ resources  that were completely unusable, even while having cities with multiple open resource slots, simply because most of the maps resources are \"factory\" resources.\\r\\n\\r\\n2)  Religion is a joke in this game.  It doesn\\'t exist in Antiquity.   Its an integral part of the exploration age.   Then its completely irrelevant in the Modern Age.  But worse, there is no defense mechanism.  Send your missionary to town.  Spread religion on city then on rural square.   City is now converted.   If an opponent sends one to your home city, your\\'s can be converted just as easy.   Is there an inquisitor or something to defend your own cities religion?   Nope.   Just summon another missionary and reconvert your own cities as needed.  And as noted, once the Age ends, you\\'ll never look at religion again.\\r\\n\\r\\n3)  There are a number of other nuisance items (like planes not being in the unit turn rotation and having to be selected manually each turn to trigger and use).   Troop movement on the map is beyond slow.   Lack of map customizations.  Too much emphasis on adjacency bonuses for buildings which makes early age \"agelesss\" buildings actually work as a penalty in future ages unless you careful plan each building location from the start.  I expect you\\'ll see strategy guides talking about \\'honeycombing\\' their city layouts with their Wonders to maximize stats.  Speaking of Wonders, the build cut scenes look like they belong in a game from 2005, not 2025.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end, I\\'ve played it through, and there\\'s certainly bones to work with, but the game feels like something that\\'s gonna sit mostly unplayed in my Steam inventory (like an Old World or Humankind) as opposed to something I\\'m gonna cycle back into on a regular basis and pile up hundreds of hours played (like I have with Civ5, Civ6, Stellaris, and other top end 4X games).', 'timestamp_created': 1740012190, 'timestamp_updated': 1740012190, 'voted_up': False, 'votes_up': 1239, 'votes_funny': 9, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.957193851470947266', 'comment_count': 24, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': False, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}\n",

You can create some really cool looking cities, towns, and landscapes. Very nice looking detailed units and building textures.  \\n(-) Pillaging/razing cities looks lame and its not intense enough imo. Too much detail was added to certain buildings for example showing small fountains that are hard to see unless zoomed in, but then little effort was put into cities burning. This could have been done on purpose due to system specs/performance, but it is one of my observations that I dont like. \\n(-) Disasters are meh looking, small, and lack intensity. Also happening too often (volcanoes erupting or floods happening every three turns?). \\n(-) Battle animations seem to stop after hitting end turn. I really like the animations, but on next turn everything seems to halt. What was once a big battle has suddenly stopped... \\n(-) Civs appear to lack flags and emblems especially on units. You get more of a feeling of red versus blue rather than civ 1 versus civ 2. Some colours are really hard to distinguish. \\n\\nSound: \\n(+) music is good and sounds as if it adapts with the civ that you play. Excellent battle sound effects. \\n(-) the battle sound effects seem to dampen in the background over time. With the music set down to low and sound effects all the way up, the battle sounds go very quiet to a point where war feels not as intense. \\n\\nCivs & Leaders:\\n(+) There are quite a few civs and leaders to choose from for the different ages and they all differ somewhat in play styles. Some of the leaders were done well (Xerxes imo ... the military one). While transitioning between ages, there are enough civs to make a historical connection (not 100% though, but with DLCs the gaps will be filled).\\n(-) I am not a fan of leaders leading civs that are not historically linked - it gives off a strange feeling in game and I cannot connect with a civilization (ex: if HT can lead Rome .... weird ... time to restart). I tend to pick the civs I go against only often to be disappointed later with their automatic choice at the next age (I want Napoleon to go Rome-Norman-France, but he chooses something bizarre, which doesn\\'t feel right). My thought on this was that it was a poor attempt by the company to add diversity to the gameplay meanwhile butchering/at the cost of immersion. \\n\\nAI:\\n(+) the AI works \"ok\" and personally on Sovereign difficulty I find it a decent setting.\\n(-) AI is easy to manipulate. It is very predictable especially if you pay attention to the leader traits. Higher difficulty setting doesn\\'t make AI smarter, but rather gives them more resources.  AI settling across the map without strategy is a problem, but this apparently will be fixed soon. \\n\\nLegacies: \\n(+) good idea if they were implemented properly. They can be fun and add purpose to each game / curve balls.\\n(-) legacies feel enforced and remove the sandbox experience. Forcing \"exploration\" in exploration age is tedious, repetitive, and flat out boring. Expansion in the original continent/area is not rewarded and forces you to \"explore\" to the new world only to find nothing exciting. \\n\\nOther: \\n(+ & -) One of my most fun things to do is plan out cities and I do this with a pen and paper since the UI is ... well ... I think you all read enough comments about it. I figured out how the system works and have been building cities quite well. Obviously there is no UI to really help you do this hence the positive and negative....  \\n(---) Several minuses to maps. I cannot stand the maps in this game. They are balanced, predictable, and boring. This is by far my major negative. No pure tundra areas, or desert, or mountain areas. its a splash of them all everywhere, almost evenly distributed for all civs. This really hurts replay-ability. It is supposed to be fixed next patch and I hope they do a good job as this is a really big game changer for me. \"Explore the new world in the exploration age only to find the same land evenly distributed\" YAWN. Not every single shore on the map has to have a beach like in Cancun, Mexico. \\n(-) Age transitions are not all that smooth. I personally don\\'t mind the age transitions and like the idea (civ7 did it better than Humankind), but you do feel at times as if something that you built is suddenly gone and you are are asked to repeat again in the new age (units disappearing, wars ending, lack of historical connections).\\n(+ & -) Battles are better than previous civ games, but I still think battles in Humankind were a bit better due to terrain/positioning. The leaders in civ 7 add a bit more depth to battles, but regardless battles tend to be too quick and easy. I think that units do too much damage and usually its the same battle strategy of having your 2-3 units focus on one to kill it quickly and then rinse and repeat (forget those battle animations as there is no chance to see them). Leaders only gain experience through battles. It doesnt feel worth it to spec them in another skill tree aside from aiding battles since you need to fight to gain experience! do these devs even play this game to notice this? \\n(-) Resources feel useless. In Humankind, if you wanted to build cavalry you needed a horse resource (makes sense right?). I love this idea and concept as it required you to think about where to settle your towns or conquer others for resources, or as a last option to trade for them. Civ 7 resources are completely a joke and have no meaning aside from earning legacy points. The +1 damage for (choose your unit here) is lazy and stupid. If I recall correctly, this is to be fixed down the road....\\n(-) The game is too pricey for the quality in what was released. I think that I got my moneys worth since I spent 200+ hours on it and with the deluxe version I think that I am covered for probably the next 1-2 months :P, but I can see that many people will be upset with the quality of the game for what you pay for. \\n(-) Another negative is the lack of innovation. The overall concept of the game was taken from Humankind, and although done better, the game play is rather dull. The legacy points system is very linear, forced, predictable, easy to manipulate, and repetitive, which imo also makes the game feel more like a mobile game and completely \"dumbed down\". The sandbox gameplay is non-existent.\\n(-) Ill stop here with a last negative. The company planned DLCs knowing the issues with the release....The game was stripped of basic features implemented in previous versions of Civ games, but deemed by management as acceptable to release only to fix them later via patches or paid DLCs. I can accept bugs in a new game, but dirty and shady sales tactics leave a bad taste in my mouth... \\n\\n(no comment on multiplayer as I did not try it)\\n\\nOVERALL: the game is fun. I would strongly recommend this game on sale. This game will get much better with time, but there are currently many issues and we will mostly likely all have to pay a lot of money going forward to get a stable and balanced product. The current formula/foundation of the game is cool, but there is a lot of work to be done to make it enjoyable and re-playable. \\n\\nIf you made it this far, cheers for reading my review. On a final note, I am happy with the current status of reviews/ratings of the game as I feel they are very accurate. IMO this game is a 6/10, but for shady sales tactics and disrespect to its customers it loses points, so its a negative review from me.      \\n\\n', 'timestamp_created': 1741394015, 'timestamp_updated': 1741394015, 'voted_up': False, 'votes_up': 925, 'votes_funny': 6, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.95589756965637207', 'comment_count': 14, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': False, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}\n",

It pains me greatly to write this as a negative review, but boy is this a let down.  I have been playing Civ games and every iteration since the first one. I had over 10k hours in Civ 6 alone across multiple platforms/accounts.  I am a massive fan of the series, so this really hurts.  Civ 6 had mixed reviews when it first released, but I still enjoyed it and it only got better.  Civ 7, I really am not enjoying it, not yet.\\n\\nThere are different aspects that need polish, like balance, bugs, flow and those can be fixed (I hope). But what bothers me the most is that at its core, Civ has tried to move away from its industry leading, tried and true formula for some bewildering reason.  Humankind was obviously the influence here, which is an enjoyable game, but it was no Civ 5 or Civ 6.  So to try model a new game after it without thinking through the whole flow and without considering what has made Civ great for decades is just puzzling. As is, Humankind is more enjoyable than whatever this is that is wrapped in a Civ 7 package.\\n\\nUI: Its been said a million times and I\\'m not going to spend much time on it.  But come on, who in their right mind thought this was remotely close to being a release worthy UI? Its like they got to the day before release and thought, OOPS WE FORGOT TO DO A UI!! Dig up the old code from Alpha Centauri and slap that UI on this for a 10x improvement while it gets its proper attention.\\n\\nThings I hope get improved:\\n\\n1) Gameplay:\\n\\nThe game as it is, is way to easy.  The biggest challenge is just the will to stay on and keep slogging through turns to finish a win condition.  The last age is the least exciting and feels like all victory options are equally unengaging and all games and playthroughs are the same.\\n\\nIn the first two ages you pretty much go down all paths just to move the age along, or at least 3 of the 4 if you want to omit wonders, wars or distant land settling. Then in the last age all paths are basically the same.  You end up building or buying most buildings as they are learned anyways since there is nothing else to do.  I suppose this could be solved by making buyout costs higher.\\n\\nEconomic - Go wide by any means, build lots of factories, take an extra 100 turns past when you could have won by other conditions to mindlessly wait for enough resources to accumulate.  \\n\\t\\nMilitary - Go wide by any means. Go fast and take 3 x the amount of cities and 3x the unhappiness via lack of city cap and lack of competing ideology. Or wait extra 50 - 100 turns turns for AI Civs to \\tchoose ideology to get 3x credit on their cities. \\n\\t\\nScience - Go wide to have the science to get to end of tree to do the necessary projects.\\n\\t\\nCulture - Literally the first civic on the tree, buy a handful of explorers and collect the artefacts before AI CIV, build the thing. Or worst case, need to get to Hegemony and get the remaining artefacts, then build the thing (still likely before getting to the first step of the other victory types, unless you are lucky enough to have a neighbouring civ select a competing ideology early enough, which I have yet to see). There are a lot of glaring balance issues. But this is one of the biggest. You can easily complete Culture victory before you have even started to research the first step in the other victory types.  Not sure if this was implemented like this as a \"get this game over with right now\" or if it is just unpolished. \\n\\nMy first 3 playthroughs on Deity were Culture, Militaristic and Science victories. There hasn\\'t been any challenge at all.  Worse though, is it feels like the choices I make are all inconsequential and don\\'t really alter the way the game is going to go.  You can blindly pick the next tech, civic up, building and roll through the game. For the most part civics and techs need to be taken in order of their branches due to being prerequisite.  \\n\\nThe way ages just end and roll over into the next age as a completely new start, I hate. You build up your Civ, do whatever strategy you want to do with things rolling along, then comes an age transition. There is too much of a hard cut fresh start with each new age that each age feels like a new game from a continuity perspective and it ruins the flow. All units are auto upgraded and moved back to bases/generals, all wars ended, all city states reset, etc etc. Then from there, each age is basically all the same goals in terms of whats needed to advance.  Expand, Expand Expand, collect thing, collect thing, collect thing. The hard reset may have been done as a way to keep AI in the \"race\" and not fall way too far behind in tech/civics, but they don\\'t transition well at all and seem to really fall off the pace in the second age.\\n\\n2) The Challenge.  It is way to easy and decisions I make feel meaningless.\\n\\n3) The flow - You are just going through the motions on everything.  There is no challenge, no real way to change things up from game to game. You need to research the same techs in roughly the same order (due to prereqs), regardless of strategy you are employing. Changing civs with ages just feels like all it does is change the icon image for units and the badge icon for the player. \\n\\n4) I miss the feeling of each game, Civ and city being unique. The art is beautiful.  But of the 20+ tiles in a large city, they ALL look the same unless you zoom into street level.  Each seems to have the art for the 2 stacked buildings then some sort of residential building based on the age.  It all just melts together and you can barely tell what is a dungeon and what is a library.  Each tile looks the same, which means each city looks the same. EVERYTHING is just the SAME with a little bit of art variance and a little bit of stat variance.  Even placing specialists, no matter the tile I put it on, they are largely the same. There is no benefit.  If we could have the unique building art be more pronounced than the standard tile art it would at least make cities not be so homogonized. Have specialist values placed on tiles be based on what is on that tile and not just a static value that differs by 0.5 gold or production. At the end of a game I couldn\\'t tell you what civs I played in that game, nothing is really differentiated to the point of me looking at the screen saying OHHH I am XYZ civ.\\n\\n5) Wonders - Seem completely useless after the first age.  Rush rush rush to build them if wanting culture points in the first age, then completely ignore them the rest of the game.  There was maybe 2 that I built that felt like they were worth it. \\n\\n6) AI - On top of the general ease of the game, the AI doesn\\'t have much variance.  In Civ 6 your first meeting with your closest neighbour would often dictate your next 20 - 30 turns. If the civ window popped up on turn 15 with your favorite Sumerian, then whatever you were building would be changed to address the war that is upcoming in 30 seconds. In 7, it seems to be all about the same, regardless of leader, especially after the first age.', 'timestamp_created': 1740426850, 'timestamp_updated': 1740426850, 'voted_up': False, 'votes_up': 154, 'votes_funny': 2, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.784632444381713867', 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': False, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}\n",

I first started playing back in 2018 on PS4 as part of the [b]new 5th Generation of Hunters[/b], completely new to the series.  \\n\\nAt its core, [b]this game isn’t special in the traditional sense[/b]—there’s [b]no deep story[/b], [b]no memorable NPC interactions[/b], and [b]no standout characters[/b]. But for me, it became a [b]second home[/b], a game filled with [b]countless memories and unforgettable experiences[/b]. It\\'s easily one of the [b]best games I’ve ever had the opportunity to play[/b].  \\n\\nThis game is exactly what its name suggests—you [b]hunt monsters[/b], with an emphasis on the word [b]hunt[/b]. You [b]study their behaviors[/b], [b]trap them[/b], [b]exploit their weaknesses[/b], and [b]adapt to their strengths[/b] in order to take them down. You use [b]various weapons, tools, and strategies[/b] to hunt these massive, catastrophic creatures, and it’s an absolute blast, especially with friends.  \\n\\nI still remember [b]being terrified of my first Anjanath[/b], running for my life, screaming and here I an about to [b]solo my first Fatalis[/b](a super boss) though I’m pretty sure I’ll fail. This game has a unique, indescribable charm to it. It constantly [b]pushes you to improve[/b], giving you that [i]butterflies-in-your-stomach[/i] feeling every time you hit a wall that seems impossible to overcome—until, suddenly, [b]everything clicks[/b].  \\n\\n[h2] Base Game & Iceborne Expansion [/h2]  \\n\\nThe game is split into two parts:  \\n- [b]Monster Hunter: World (Base Game)[/b] – This was my [b]introduction[/b] to the series, and I already liked it.  \\n- [b]Iceborne (DLC Expansion)[/b] – This is where I [b]fell in love[/b] with the game.  \\n\\nIceborne [b]forced me to \"Git Gud\"[/b]—Master Rank hunts are no joke, especially post-Iceborne content like [b]Tempered Furious Rajang[/b] and [b]Arch-Tempered Velkhana[/b]. No matter how much I improve, I still can’t beat them, but teaming up with random players and hacking away at these monsters is a ton of fun.  \\n\\nThe game is [b]easy to pick up but hard to master[/b]. The difficulty spikes can be [b]brutal and abrupt[/b], so take your time, be patient, and adapt you’re a hunter, and finding a way to take down the monster is part of the challenge.  \\n\\nThis game [b]isn’t for everyone[/b]—some might even hate it and never want to touch it again. But give it a shot—who knows? You might end up loving it just as much as I did.  \\n\\nI loved this game so much that I bought it a second time on Steam, along with the Iceborne DLC when it went on sale. The DLC is locked behind the main game, so you need to reach a certain point before accessing it, but it’s 100% worth it. It actually [b]provides more content than the base game itself but only buy it after completing the base game.\\n\\n[h2] ❌ Cons & Performance Issues [/h2]  \\n\\nThis game [b]isn’t perfect[/b], and there are some [b]performance issues[/b], but they can be improved:  \\n\\n- The game has [b]too much unoptimized code[/b] that causes unnecessary performance drops. A simple fix is to install a mod called [b]\"Performance Booster and Plugin Extender\"[/b] from NexusMods. This mod significantly improves performance and is easy to install.  \\n> [i]Note: Mods in this game [b]do not disable achievements[/b], so [b]completionists[/b] can use them without worries.[/i]  \\n\\n- [b]Turn off Volumetric Fog[/b] if you’re experiencing performance issues. \\n\\n[h2] Final Thoughts [/h2]  \\n\\nMonster Hunter: World is an awesome game. It’s nothing groundbreaking, but it’s a hell of a lot of fun.  I’m planning to buy Monster Hunter: Wilds when it comes out, I played its open beta, and it was a blast.  \\nI might update this review if I manage to beat Fatalis, get 100% achievements, and finally [b]wrap up this game[/b].', 'timestamp_created': 1740475385, 'timestamp_updated': 1740475385, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 84, 'votes_funny': 1, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.85429537296295166', 'comment_count': 1, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': False, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}\n",

This game is an RPG with so much personality, style, and detail that I can’t help but recommend it. However, there are some mechanics that could either draw you in or turn you away completely.\\n\\n[olist]\\n[*]Story multiplayer – Each monster has a unique cutscene that must be viewed before you can play with a friend. That means if you want to play through the story, you’ll need to do this weird dance where you enter the mission, watch the cutscene, then invite your friend while trying not to get annihilated by the new monster attacking you. it's still worth it if you enjoy playing with friends, but it is tedious.\\n\\n[*]Fight time – If you’re new to these types of games, be prepared to spend anywhere from 10 to 30+ minutes fighting some of these monsters, depending on your skill level. In late game as an experience player, you can get them down to 5-10 minutes but overall, these monsters are meant to be lengthy fights where they will run to survive and use the environment to their advantage. It makes the fights feel real, but I can see this frustrating some players, especially since there is a timer that is always running and cannot be paused. \\n\\n[*]The grind – There is so much customization in this game: interesting builds, mixing and matching armor and weapons. The more you play, the easier the game gets. It’s an RPG player's dream, but of course, you’ll need to work for it. Although there are good methods for farming, we all eventually will need to grind for that one material. If you’re just here for the story and a couple of optional fights, it’s really not that bad. But once you get to endgame, prepare yourself. One of the endgame locations, the Guiding Lands is literally nicknamed the Grinding Lands by the player base because it is that bad. If you want the absolute best gear, it will take a long time. I’ve beaten every monster in the game solo and still have not maxed out my main weapon.\\n\\n[*]The weapon tree/forging and upgrade system – Every new player I see is confused and overwhelmed upon viewing this abomination of a UI. Basically, you forge weapons in one tree, then navigate to another UI, which looks the same, to upgrade them. I refuse to believe there isn’t a better way to do this. If you’ve played these games, it’s not an issue, but if your UI confuses the majority of new players every time, then there’s probably a better way. A minor issue, but we can do better.\\n[/olist]\\n\\nAt the end of the day, you either like this style of gameplay or you don’t—that’s it. But I think it deserves a chance at least. The excitement of seeing a new monster, somehow more powerful than the last, and defeating it to craft its unique gear is such a joy. Every fight feels rewarding, you’re always working towards something. Even after 200 hours, I discovered that you could climb the mountain in the ice map all the way to the top, where a rare celestial jellyfish can spawn for you to catch and display in your room. These small details accumulate to create special maps that are still interesting to explore years after release.\\n\\nIn short, does this game have issues and mechanics that some people won’t enjoy? Of course. But the detail, care, and passion put into this game are some of the best, and it deserves to be played. That feeling of overcoming an impossible obstacle is unmatched—from your first fight all the way to your last.\", 'timestamp_created': 1740700296, 'timestamp_updated': 1740700378, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 13, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.648752748966217041', 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': False, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}\n",

Tried playing it again I'm a single player survival type player I loved state of decay back in the day. For my type of player I would not recommend this game. Can you have fun with it absolutely but trying it again I see the main reasons why I stopped playing still remain.\\r\\n3 main reasons what is holding this game back\\r\\n1-gameplay loop\\r\\n2-controller support\\r\\n3-mods support\\r\\nI play with controller mostly even still the amount of controllers this game has is too many even for keyboard players I think it is too many so half the time I am just pressing and reading the controller options wasting game time.\\r\\nGameplay loop for this game I think it is solid survival type scavenge and survive simple right some games do this loop right and rewarding. Scum does not, it has one but man does it get boring real fast and even if you stick with it there is nothing really to do afterwards. I get it this is more a pvp server mmo type game but I mean this game has so much untapped potential the world is pretty and massive and the foundation for the game I think is pretty solid.\\r\\nWhich leads to my next point mods if this game had mod support man I think it would blow up, boring gameplay loop no problem mods could add some fun quests. Lack of customization mods can help with that. Survival too restrictive or too lax mods can change that. I know some of this issues can be fixed with servers but I am speaking from a singleplayer perspective this game is a really pretty gem of a game but man is it a boring empty gem. Still some hope maybe after 1.0 mods can come along and this game will change but I really doubt from what I seen the devs don't really care listening to their players and after playing this game again after so many years I agree. Another game with lots of potential but will never reach it. Atleast I paid really cheap to try it out.

I write down everything the streamer does thinking I will analyze what all the options mean and try to piece out why those were good decisions. I go into the game, start following the list, and one of the estate options I am supposed to do is not in my game. Apparently it's specific to the domination DLC. $20 bucks. Hmm. Oh well, keep calm and carry on. I can probably still follow this guide and get a feel for the game. Hm. One of the diplomatic options the streamer uses, 'curry favor' is not in my game. Apparently that's specific to the leviathan DLC. $20 bucks. Wait - I think my mission tree options look different than his mission tree options. Yes, locked behind specific DLCs, there, too. And that's my breaking point. Quit out. Uninstall.  Decide to write this review to vent my frustration.\\n\\nI am betting EU4 is still a fantastic game for those that have been consistently playing and keeping up with the DLC as they come out, learning little by little what's changed.

LOL\\r\\n- The landscapes\\r\\n- The stories and large choice of different activities, that don't exclude each other so we can do everything.\\r\\n\\r\\nI dislike mainly:\\r\\n- The combat concept: if we move, casting is interrupted (!). So, it's either I cast but suffers under foes damages, or I escape fields of damages, but can't cast. That's strange to me. As well that there is no dodging. \\r\\n- The travel concept: either expensive or taking long time and can be unsafe if we chose to run.\\r\\n- The map and its markers, for me very confusing. I had to abandon leves, because out of all the markers on the map, I was unable to understand/see where is the target I need to reach.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would have a lot more to say, but I keep it at the main first impressions out of those 20 hours I did up to now. I recommend the game because it's fun. For the combat concept, I come from other games where it's different and I probably need some time to adapt. For the travelling, maybe that I will discover later that it can be a bit more user friendly.

I’ve played Battlefield games for years, and I can confidently say: this is THE BEST Battlefield game to ever exist. It captures the chaos of war like no other, blending jaw-dropping visuals, adrenaline-pumping gameplay, and pure cinematic brilliance into an FPS masterpiece.\\n\\n[h3]The Unmatched Battlefield Experience[/h3]\\n\\nFrom the moment you load into Battlefield 1, you’re greeted by an atmosphere unlike anything in the series. The sound design alone is enough to send chills down your spine—bullets whizzing past, artillery shells raining destruction, the desperate screams of soldiers in the heat of battle. Every explosion, every shot fired, every bayonet charge feels like you’ve been transported to the battlefields of World War I.\\n\\nThe graphics and environmental destruction are absolutely breathtaking, even years after release. Mud gets kicked up, buildings crumble under relentless bombardment, and fire engulfs the land as war rages on. No other Battlefield title captures the raw, gritty reality of combat like this one.\\n\\n[h3]The QF 1 AA – The Most Satisfying Anti-Air Experience Ever[/h3]\\n\\nLet’s talk about THE most satisfying feeling in gaming: playing AA on the QF 1 AA gun.\\n\\nThe sheer power and control you feel when manning the QF 1 Anti-Aircraft Gun is second to none. Seeing a squadron of enemy planes soaring overhead, lining up your sights, and unleashing a devastating barrage that sends them spiraling to the ground? Pure bliss.\\n\\nWhether it’s shredding bombers before they can unleash devastation, taking down attack planes trying to strafe your team, or scoring the ultimate kill on an elite fighter ace—AA gameplay in Battlefield 1 is unmatched. You feel like the last line of defense against an airborne menace, and the thrill of obliterating aerial threats never gets old.\\n\\n[h3]Operations Mode – The Pinnacle of Battlefield Multiplayer[/h3]\\n\\nForget Conquest, forget Rush, Operations Mode is where Battlefield 1 truly shines. The large-scale battles feel cinematic in a way no other Battlefield mode has ever achieved. The maps are massive, the objectives are dynamic, and the Behemoths—oh my god, the Behemoths.\\n\\nThe Blimp soaring in as a last-ditch effort to turn the tide of battle? The Armored Train, tearing through defenses and pushing the front lines forward? These aren’t just gimmicks—they’re game-changers that create legendary moments every single match. The feeling of being a part of a desperate last stand or a relentless advance makes every match feel like a historic war movie in real-time.\\n\\n[h3]Dogfights – The Ultimate Aerial Warfare[/h3]\\n\\nAir combat in Battlefield 1 isn’t just good—it’s PERFECTION.\\n\\nDogfighting in this game is art. Whether you’re a skilled pilot pulling off insane aerial maneuvers or a gunner in the back seat trying to protect your ace pilot at all costs, the thrill of air combat is unmatched.\\n\\nFlying a nimble fighter and weaving through the skies in intense 1v1 duels? Adrenaline overload.\\n\\nBombing ground targets while dodging AA fire? An absolute rush.\\n\\nSitting in the back seat of a bomber, blasting enemy planes out of the sky with pinpoint accuracy? The most rewarding support role ever.\\n\\nEvery aerial battle tells a story, every kill is earned, and every crash is a dramatic end to a breathtaking duel.\\n\\n[h3]Why This Is Battlefield’s Peak[/h3]\\n\\nThe balance of weapons, vehicles, and teamwork in Battlefield 1 is perfect. Every class has a purpose, every vehicle has a counter, and the game rewards both individual skill and team coordination. Unlike later entries in the franchise (cough BF2042 cough), Battlefield 1 understood what makes Battlefield great:\\n\\n✅ Immersive, cinematic gameplay\\n✅ Destructible, dynamic environments\\n✅ Vehicles that actually feel powerful\\n✅ Class-based teamwork that matters\\n✅ A perfect blend of chaos and strategy\\n\\nEvery match is different, every moment is memorable, and every battle feels like history in the making.\\n\\n[h3]Final Verdict – The FPS Masterpiece[/h3]\\n\\nYears later, no FPS has captured my heart like Battlefield 1. The gunplay, the vehicles, the destruction, the music, the tension, the sheer epic scale—this is what an FPS should be.\\n\\nIf you’ve never played it, do yourself a favor and experience Battlefield at its absolute peak. If you have played it, then you already know why this game deserves all the praise.\\n\\n🎖 11/10 – The Greatest Battlefield Game Ever Made. 🎖', 'timestamp_created': 1740119403, 'timestamp_updated': 1740119966, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 150, 'votes_funny': 6, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.849279224872589111', 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': False, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}\n",

It is a remake of the original Counter-Strike game, utilizing the Source engine, which allowed for enhanced graphics, physics, and environmental interactions. Players are split into two teams: the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists, competing in rounds to complete objectives such as planting bombs or rescuing hostages. The game is known for its tactical gameplay, emphasis on team coordination, and its strong competitive nature.\\n\\n🌟 Pros\\n✅ Updated Graphics and Physics – The Source engine gives Counter-Strike: Source superior visuals and realistic physics, enhancing immersion, especially in environmental destruction and character animations.\\n✅ Tactical Gameplay – The game continues the Counter-Strike tradition of strategic, team-based gameplay that requires communication and coordination between teammates.\\n✅ Balanced Gameplay – CS: Source offers a wide variety of weapons and tactics, with no one weapon being overwhelmingly powerful, making for a balanced experience.\\n✅ Strong Competitive Scene – Counter-Strike: Source helped build the competitive FPS scene and has a strong community of players and regular tournaments.\\n✅ Modding and Customization – The game has a thriving modding community, allowing players to create custom maps, skins, and game modes.\\n\\n⚠️ Cons\\n❌ Outdated Visuals for Modern Standards – While the Source engine improved visuals from the original Counter-Strike, the game’s graphics may still feel outdated compared to newer FPS titles.\\n❌ Steep Learning Curve – New players may struggle to understand the mechanics and map strategies, especially when matched with veteran players.\\n❌ Player Base Decline – As newer Counter-Strike titles, such as CS:GO, have been released, the player base for CS: Source has dwindled, making it more difficult to find consistent, active matches.\\n❌ Limited New Content – With the release of CS:GO, CS: Source has received fewer updates and new content, which can make it feel stagnant over time.\\n\\n💬 Player Sentiment\\nPositive Reviews: Longtime fans of the Counter-Strike franchise appreciate the nostalgia of CS: Source, with many praising its tactical depth, balanced gameplay, and immersive mechanics.\\n\\nNegative Reviews: Criticism is mainly directed at the aging visuals, dwindling player base, and the fact that it doesn’t innovate enough to compete with more modern shooters.\\n\\n🎯 Target Audience\\n\\nFans of tactical, team-based FPS games.\\nGamers who enjoy competitive multiplayer gameplay.\\nPlayers who have nostalgia for the Counter-Strike series but want an updated version of the original.\\n🏆 Rating Breakdown\\n🎮 Gameplay: 9/10\\n🎨 Graphics & Art Style: 8.5/10\\n⚙️ Physics & Mechanics: 9/10\\n🔄 Replayability: 8.5/10\\n👥 Community: 7/10\\nOverall Experience: 9.0/10\\n\\n🎯 Final Verdict\\nCounter-Strike: Source remains a solid, competitive FPS that benefits from its tactical gameplay and tight controls. While its visuals may feel outdated by today’s standards, the game still offers an engaging and balanced experience for fans of competitive shooters. However, with the increasing popularity of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, the player base for CS: Source has dwindled, making it a better fit for those seeking a nostalgic or more casual Counter-Strike experience.', 'timestamp_created': 1740920673, 'timestamp_updated': 1740920673, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 9, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.564954876899719238', 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': False, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}\n",

It gets repetitive towards the end as there isn't really much enemy variation. The game can get pretty tough and it really doesn't hold your hand in the higher difficulties.

É complicado...\\r\\n\\r\\nResumo: Se você ama a franquia The Elder Scrolls, gosta da estrutura de questing clássica dos MMOs e adora acompanhar a história (que é toda, até a menor quest, voice acted) vale muito experimentar o jogo. Se você é fascinado por um PvP frenético e de alta qualidade (e não se importa de gastar um rim pra ter acesso a todo conteúdo do jogo) também vale muito a pena. Se o seu foco é PVE em grupo, como dungeons e raids, o jogo também oferece uma experiência bacana (que custa um rim, rs), mas acredito que tenham outros MMOs melhores para isso no mercado. Agora se você é um solo player APENAS, você vai estar perdendo as partes mais bacanas do jogo, mas também tem bastante conteúdo pra se fazer solo. E caso decida embarcar nessa aventura, lembre-se: A Bethesda cria os problemas do jogo pra poder te vender as soluções depois. Se dinheiro não é um problema, seja feliz.\\r\\n\\r\\nOs prós: apesar do que muitos faladores comentam, acredito que o combate do jogo seja um dos pontos fortes. O action combat do ESO, pra mim, é como um sucessor espiritual do DDO, no início pode parecer meio estranho, mas conforme você vai entendo como tirar o máximo de animation cancel, o negócio vai ficando bem recompensador e divertido. Eu não acho que as main stories do ESO sejam as melhores entre os MMOs, mas elas são consistentemente boas. Pra quem aprecia as partes mais clássicas de um RPG, é muito fácil ficar imerso no jogo, mesmo com as quests mais simples, tudo por conta do excelente voice acting e pequenas histórias contadas através das quests. Outro ponto positivo do jogo é o PVP. Claro que esse é um tópico tão pessoal quanto o c*, mas na minha opinião, esse é disparado o melhor PVP no mercado de MMOs (se você não levar em consideração o rim que está abrindo mão pra jogar isso aqui). E por último gostaria de enaltecer a liberdade que se tem pra buildar nesse jogo (claro, se você tiver aberto mão do seu carro para financiar todas DLCs e pagar o Plus). No ESO você pode desbloquear e upar diversas skill lines e misturá-las no seu kit da maneira que achar melhor, te possibilitando buildar quase qualquer coisa, é quase como um ARPG nesse sentido.\\r\\n\\r\\nOs contras: Eu já comentei como é caro jogar esse jogo? Falando sério agora, com a mais nova atualização de 10 anos de ESO, você consegue comprar todas expansões por 250 Lulas, um preço razoavelmente acessível. Se parasse por aí tava tudo bem, mas o jogo ainda conta com dezenas de DLCs que você deve comprar com cash ou liberar acesso pagando a mensalidade de míseros 50 reais. Continuando nesse tópico, a mensalidade também te garante a crafting bag para armazenar todos os materiais que você vai utilizar no crafting, sem o Plus todos esses materiais vão pra bag normal, tornando sua vida IMPOSSÍVEL. Agora que já falamos sobre o elefante na sala, vamos falar sobre os problemas que eu vejo no jogo em si. O primeiro deles é a falta de identidade de classes (isso pode não ser um problema pra vc). Como temos a liberdade de buildar utilizando todas skill lines que temos acesso, muitas vezes as classes podem parecer mais ou menos a mesma coisa (acredito que poderiam introduzir mecânicas únicas de cada classe, fora as skills). Apesar do jogo ter uma história riquíssima, muitos assets do jogo são excessivamente reutilizados e você acaba passando por lugares e dungeons diferentes com a sensação de que já passou por ali antes. Apesar do jogo ter um mapa GIGANTESCO, parece que a zenimax não criou sistemas e eventos suficientes que te incentivem  explorar mais do mapa, de maneira orgânica, como é no GW2, por exemplo. Então muita gente acaba com a sensação da única utilidade do mapa ser fazer as quests e upar de level, muito parecido com World of Warcraft (e considero isso um desperdício de conteúdo e tempo de desenvolvimento). Outro ponto negativo é o conteúdo da história ter uma dificuldade absolutamente trivial. Não acho que deveria ser difícil, mas pelo menos me deixar com medo de morrer vez ou outra (não se preocupem que no PVE em grupo e PVP tem dificuldade até demais as vezes, rs).', 'timestamp_created': 1740962605, 'timestamp_updated': 1740962605, 'voted_up': False, 'votes_up': 2, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.518518567085266113', 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': False, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}\n",

It features plenty of road, dirt, cross country, and street racing, plus a good handful of speed traps, speed zones, drift zones, and jump challenges. At the same time, it leans into the vehicular adventure and story offerings, giving this open-world arcade driving game a bit more structure for (new) players who need some guidance on where to begin.\\n\\nIn Horizon Adventure, you are tasked with establishing outposts for the main event, road racing, dirt racing, cross country racing, PR stunts, and street racing. You then earn Accolades to unlock and take on the outposts’ lineups of expeditions and stories, as well as win the finale races. Of these, I especially enjoyed the few stories that flesh out the supporting characters, specifically Alejandra and Ramiro.\\n\\n“Vocho” tells the importance of the VW Beetle to Alejandra’s family, and to Mexico by extension. It plays like [I]FH4[/I]’s “British Racing Green”, but with a touch of personal history. Ramiro’s fun nature shines in “Lucha de Carreteras”, which features street racing infused with lucha libre styling. “V10”, the sequel to [I]FH4[/I]’s “The Stunt Driver” that marks the return of stunt coordinator Mike Steele and actor Frankie Beaumont, is also a standout.\\n\\n[I]FH5[/I]’s map is the largest one in the series to date, with varied geographical and topographical features: desert, volcano, mountain range, wetland, jungles, beaches, and plains. This map is also meteorologically diverse, with adjacent areas possibly having different weather conditions. To see a dust storm brew up during spring season is breathtaking, and to race into it is thrilling.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3412788084\\nWhat I enjoy about [I]FH5[/I]’s Accolades system is its clarity.

Essentially, [I]FH5[/I] fine-tunes the tried-and-true gameplay that [I]FH4[/I] offered, and provides a more well-rounded and approachable gaming experience as a result.\\n\\nThat being said, Accolades being one of the measures of success makes Horizon Adventure a bit too easy. Despite my benefitting from it, I feel like I didn’t earn the privilege to participate in the finale races. Does it make sense that I get to race in The Marathon, the Horizon Street Scene finale race, without having competed in a street race event? Frankly, once you’ve completed the finale race, going back to the individual race events is rather anticlimactic.\\n\\nThe game’s large map, while a selling point, is also a weakness. With points of interest far apart and the scenery in between being generally unremarkable, long drives get tiresome quickly. In fact, it’s more fun, efficient and productive to drive from point A to B as crow flies, so you can earn some Skill Points while you blaze across the terrain. While I’m partial to road races in [I]Forza Horizon[/I] games, I found this Mexico game map to be remarkably conducive to cross country racing and trailblazer challenges. They’re easily the best racing parts of [I]FH5[/I].\\n\\nOn the other hand, I found dirt racing to be spectacular, and road racing exhilarating in the [I]Rally Adventure[/I] and [I]Hot Wheels[/I] expansion packs respectively. The Badlands map in [I]Rally Adventure[/I] is more compact, but topographically interesting and fun to explore. Rally racing, a new addition to the [I]Forza Horizon[/I] franchise, introduces a layer of complexity to dirt racing that I welcome wholeheartedly. I’ve started playing rally racing in first-person mode for the extra sense of realism and excitement.\\n\\n[I]Hot Wheels[/I] feels wholly unique with the setting being three aerial islands connected by the toys’ signature orange tracks, as well as ice tracks, water flumes, and magnet tracks. Although you’re confined to the tracks most of the time, thus losing some open-world exploration, speeding through loop-the-loops, diving straight into a volcano, and winding through giant trees and mountains mid-air, exploring this fantastical racing wonderland at top speed make up for the constraints.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3412788046\\nAnd once you’ve played these expansion packs, the flaws of the main game’s map become more apparent. With it being so big, it regularly feels empty during the past two months of playing. I rarely run into other online players on the road since they’d often be hanging out at the Horizon Festival outpost or seasonal challenge locations. Other outposts are usually empty. With few traffic vehicles on the roads as well, the game world feels very dull.\\n\\nOnly Guanajuato, one of two featured cities, makes for interesting setting for races. Its winding narrow roads make street racing exciting, and its underground tunnels make the Hide and Seek game mode rather challenging. And of the four featured archeological sites, only Ek’Balam and Teotihuacan get the most exposure and use. It’s a shame not all landmarks get the same love and attention.\\n\\nAt the time of writing, [I]FH5[/I] is on its 43rd and final monthly Festival Playlist series that features daily and weekly challenges. After this, the game will re-release previous series as voted by the community. This is great news for me because being late to [I]FH5[/I] and having already spent over 200 hours playing, it’s the daily and weekly challenges that keep me coming back, even if it’s just for several minutes. If it weren’t for the live service content, I would have stopped playing tens of hours ago.\\n\\nRegardless of [I]FH5[/I]’s longevity at the time of this review, I think this game is absolutely worth playing even without the live service content. While I admit the game is less fun without them, there is plenty of offline content in [I]FH5[/I] to satisfy fans of arcade driving and open-world adventure games. Because the gameplay is fine-tuned and accessible, and made even more fun with the two expansion packs, I recommend not just the Standard Edition game, but also the Premium Edition.\\n\\nThe 43rd series being the last one hints at news of [I]Forza Horizon 6[/I] being on the…uh, horizon. If the content of [I]FH4[/I] and this game were any indication, the next game will continue to feature stories about the host country or region’s automotive and racing history, and showcase its geography and monuments. Given that, I’m guessing [I]FH6[/I] will be set in either Germany or Japan. Whether I’m right or not, I’m looking forward to a sequel. Here’s hoping [I]FH6[/I] will smooth out the few rough edges of this game and give us an even more polished racing adventure experience.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3410009103', 'timestamp_created': 1739850354, 'timestamp_updated': 1740802834, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 46, 'votes_funny': 4, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.758696377277374268', 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': False, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}\n",

This is unacceptable for a game that\\'s been out for 4 years and where the developers are actively publishing DLC and other packs but aren\\'t maintaining the health of the game.\\r\\n3 - Excessively Priced: The base game is 60 dollars, and it comes in editions scaling up to 100 dollars. This \"Premium Pack\" does NOT include the Car DLC Pack which is an additional 75 dollars. And honestly, the Premium pack doesn\\'t give anything that\\'s honestly worth it--the cars it gives are kind of garbage and the cosmetic items are \\'meh\\' at best.\\r\\n4 - Not Optimized for Streaming: Unless you\\'re a live camera streamer, this game is going to cause your VRM software to excessively lag. This is a minor gripe for everyone else and will not apply to most people.\\r\\n5 - Unskippable Lengthy Cutscenes: NONE, absolutely NONE of the cutscenes in this game allow you to skip them.

You are -forced- to have to sit through their boring storytelling for 30 seconds upwards to almost 2 minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have one final gripe for the game, and this one is THE most serious of them all...\\r\\n\\r\\n6 - DOXes your first real-life name: Exactly as it is stated.

If I'm purchasing a specific part just allow me to purchase it instead of adding it to a parts list and then making the player go through another set of menus only to show a large list of the parts you thought you already purchased and then ask again if you're sure you want to purchase them. \\n\\nThe menuing just makes me want to avoid it at all costs. That includes purchasing new vehicles, buying, selling and trading. Its just a mess. \\n\\nOn to the actual races. The races are fun but aren't all that challenging. For the most part you can get into first early on in the race and hold that position with no real competition.
